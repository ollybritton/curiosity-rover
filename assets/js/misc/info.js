Our intrepid explorer is truly back at it after a few weeks off due to the anomaly. The short drive (also called a bump) placed us in a workspace a few meters away from our previous location where we had attempted to drill (see image above that shows a MAHLI observation of the shallow drill hole).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this weekend's three-sol plan there will be several diagnostic activities that will help us to understand the anomaly. In addition to the diagnostics, the weekend plan includes ChemCam and Mastcam observations of \"Dryden\" and \"Kirkness,\" which are bedrock targets, and of \"Housay,\" which is a vein within the bedrock. Also included is a Mastcam observation of \"Eynhallow\" to document laminations within the bedrock, a MARDI image, and a Navcam dust devil survey.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ChemCam RMI Zenith Sky Flats scheduled on the first sol. In this activity ChemCam will take images looking up at the sky. This activity needs to happen near sunset because ChemCam should not look directly at the sun. These sky flats help us determine whether there is any dust contamination on ChemCam's optical window, which is important right now because Mars just experienced a global dust event.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the second sol, APXS and MAHLI will be used to investigate two targets: \"Calgary\" and \"Findon.\" Calgary is typical gray bedrock, and this target will be brushed with the DRT prior to the MAHLI and APXS measurements.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the third sol Curiosity will drive towards Lake Orcadie, and next week we plan to start our drill campaign in the gray colored rocks at that location!</p>"}, "2218": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2218-no-candy-just-science-for-curiosity", "text": "<p>Curiosity had a good Halloween because it had resumed contact science. Today, Curiosity will have a targeted science block, drive, and then have an untargeted science block. MAHLI will take images of the \"Lossiemouth\" target before the drive. ChemCam has two planned targets before the drive: \"Milton Ness\" and \"Grange 2218.\" Milton Ness is a target to capture more of the vein material and some bedrock, too. We are taking more measurements of Grange so we have more information on the dark inclusions. There is also scheduled Mastcam imagery for each ChemCam target.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter these science activities, we will be headed toward an area in the grey Jura member called \"Lake Orcadie.\" This would be the first time that Curiosity has driven in six weeks. This will only be a test drive to ensure the software and mechanics are working properly. Curiosity was at Lake Orcadie before, back on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1977-return-of-the-drill\">sol 1977</a>.

It can use Curiosity\u2019s cameras to identify rocks, and then AEGIS uses ChemCam\u2019s laser to shoot the rocks. This has increased the amount of data we can get from Gale Crater.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy operations role today was ChemCam science downlink lead.

When the anomaly occurred, the APXS was poised to measure the composition of the freshly exposed \"Inverness\" bedrock surface (after an unsuccessful drill attempt on Sol 2170) to compare with the previously brushed surface and other fresh rock surfaces examined by APXS on the Vera Rubin Ridge. The plan today is to recover this measurement, with accompanying MAHLI imaging, as well as to get chemical and textural data (with APXS and MAHLI) on another interesting target in the workspace, \"Grange.\" \"Grange\" appears to be an area of bright calcium sulfate (commonly observed as veins cross-cutting bedrock encountered throughout the mission), but with small, dark inclusions that might have an interesting composition. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also planned ChemCam on a bedrock target \"Clune\" with accompanying Mastcam imaging, as well as Mastcam imaging of an interesting area of rougher textured rock \"Ayr\" and multispectral Mastcam observations of the \"Inverness\" area. The plan was rounded out with some environmental monitoring activities including DAN passive and REMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to getting the data down from these observations and comparing the chemistry and textures of these rocks with other rock targets encountered on the Vera Rubin Ridge. The chemistry and textures can provide clues to the conditions the sediments were deposited in as well as subsequent events such as diagenesis (as the sediment is buried, compacted and cemented and turned into a rock), and later alteration.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking ahead, Curiosity is hoping to soon drive away from this site towards an area, \"Lake Orcadie,\" where we will attempt another drill into one of these interesting bright grey areas identified from orbit on the Vera Rubin Ridge.</p>"}, "2216": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2216-a-windswept-workspace", "text": "<p>Today was the first day of planning with the full science team since Curiosity had an anomaly on sol 2172.

Before the anomaly, the rock was covered with gray-colored tailings from our failed attempt to drill the \"Inverness\" target, as seen in the Mastcam image from <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=2171MR0116930010105700E01_DXXX&amp;s=2171\">sol 2170</a>.

So while Curiosity has been sitting still, the winds have been moving, sweeping the workspace clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater this week we plan to take advantage of this freshly-scrubbed surface by taking close-up MAHLI images of fine details in the rock, including the light-toned veins crisscrossing the outcrop that are peppered with interesting dark inclusions. Today we're easing back into science operations, taking MAHLI images with the cover open and closed to inspect how much dust is on the cover, a MAHLI image of the REMS UV sensor, a ChemCam observation of the vein target \"Grange,\" and some Mastcam images of the nearby ripple field \"Sandend\" to look for more changes due to the wind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my role as a Long-Term Planner, I've got my eye on the road ahead, and I'm excited for Curiosity to drive to a new spot where we can successfully drill into the gray rock.

Today we are doing some environmental and atmospheric observations with REMS, RAD, and DAN. We're also using our Engineering cameras to do atmospheric science observations and some sky imaging to help in camera calibration. Mastcam is also being used for the first time to take several atmospheric tau measurements, as well as looking out at our workspace and the targets we were investigating.

These real-time data are transmitting normally, and include various details about the rover's status. Engineers are expanding the details the rover transmits in these real-time data to better diagnose the issue. Because the amount of data coming down is limited, it might take some time for the engineering team to diagnose the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday and Tuesday, engineers discussed which real-time details would be the most useful to have. They also commanded the rover to turn off science instruments that were still on, since their data are not being stored. They're also preparing to use the rover's backup computer in case they need to use it to diagnose the primary computer. That backup computer was the rover's primary one until Sol 200, when it experienced both a hardware failure and software issue that have since been addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the engineers work to understand the problem, Curiosity's science team is using the time to pore over data gathered on Vera Rubin Ridge and come up with the best location for another drilling attempt. We're looking at any clues that tell us the rocks are weaker and better for drilling. As the JPL-based project scientist, I really enjoy watching our scientists from all over the world take on these challenges. And, I also get to witness the brainpower that JPL brings to bear when the rover has a technical issue.

Today's tactical team bounced back from this news and quickly assembled a plan to move on. This proved to be a busy day for the whole team, including me as the Geology Keeper of the Plan!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur first order of business was discussing where to drive next. The grey Jura member is a top priority for sampling and understanding the geologic history of the Vera Rubin Ridge, so we felt it was imperative to try again. We ultimately decided to return to the \"Lake Orcadie\" region, where we previously attempted to drill on Sol 1977. In the past attempt, we were able to reach 10 mm depth using rotary only, so we are hopeful that this next attempt will reach sampling depths with the new percussion-enhanced drill capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore driving off, we wrapped up at the Inverness site with APXS and ChemCam spectral measurements to characterize the composition of the drill tailings and the mini drill hole. We additionally targeted \"Clune,\" a grey Jura bedrock, with ChemCam to continue our documentation of compositional heterogeneities in bedrock. Some science team members also identified two possible meteorite targets, so we obtained a ChemCam measurement of \"Stoneyburn\" and a Mastcam multispectral observation of \"Rockend\" to see if they have meteorite compositions. On Sol 2173, we planned a long 65 m drive to get Curiosity close to our next drill site in the Lake Orcadie region. We ended the plan on Sol 2174 with ChemCam calibration and sky observations, as well as our usual post-drive MARDI twilight image to document the terrain beneath the rover.

It was pretty interesting from a science perspective to see this <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2114-finishing-up-at-the-voyageurs-drill-site\">result</a>, but it also meant we had to work quickly to figure out a plan B. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe science team agreed it was scientifically important enough to get a drill sample from the lower part of Vera Rubin Ridge that we should try again. But how could we improve our chances of finding a rock that would be softer and easier to drill than Voyageurs? It was time to think like geologists.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the absence of direct data on rock mechanical properties, we came up with three criteria that we could use to try to find a softer rock. (1) Did the bristles of the DRT brush leave scratches on the rocks' surfaces? While not necessarily a direct indicator of what the rock strength would be when we drilled into it, we could at least say rocks that got scratched with the DRT had a softer surface than those that didn't. (2) How well exposed are the white calcium sulfate veins? On some rock targets, like Stoer, we clearly see veins. On other targets, like Voyageurs, the veins are recessed into the rock. Recessed veins erode much faster than the surrounding bedrock because the surrounding bedrock is harder. Non-recessed veins tells us the bedrock may be similar in strength to the veins, or, if the veins stick out, the bedrock may be lower in strength. (3) What does the large-scale topography tell us? Broadly, Vera Rubin Ridge is a ridge because it is composed of hard rocks that are more resistant to erosion than their surroundings. We realized we might use this same logic to find softer rocks within the ridge by trying to drill in local topographic lows or at bases of scarps where the bottom of the scarp is eroding more quickly than the hard rocks on top.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, because we had already explored a lot of Vera Rubin Ridge, we already had lots of data in hand to search for our next drill targets. Several members of the science team put in impressive efforts to quickly go through all of the images we'd taken in the last 200 sols, and we found just a handful of candidates than fit our criteria. The area near \"Ailsa Craig\" was close to Voyageurs and looked different enough that we thought it was worth a go. We made more progress drilling into this target than Voyageurs, but <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-2124-2126-its-a-hard-rock-life\">still not enough</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Stoer\" was our final choice, and it was initially chosen because it was near the base of a scarp and had more prominently expressed veins. We all had a really good feeling about this target when we saw the DRT had scratched it, and were thrilled when we saw a successful drill hole. Apparently third time really was the charm for us!<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back on all the drills over the course of the mission, I think Stoer has got to be one of my favorites. Not only have I been personally wondering about the rocks on Vera Rubin Ridge for <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2109-voyageurs\">six years</a>, but the fact that the science team worked so hard to find this not-so-hard rock makes this particular drill extra sweet.</p>"}, "2155": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2155-what-a-dump", "text": "<p>Our second attempt at a dump was successful!

We had enough power to reattempt the sample dump, the MAHLI imaging on the dump pile, and two APXS integrations on the dump pile. We planned Mastcam and Navcam images of the workspace after the sample is dumped to enable us to target the dump pile with ChemCam in the next couple of sols. A MAHLI image of the drill hole and tailings will help us plan APXS placement on the tailings as soon as tomorrow's plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to making forward progress on drill activities, Curiosity continued to learn more about the dust kicked up by the now-waning dust storm conditions. A weekend dress rehearsal of a ChemCam passive observation of the Sun was successful, so today's plan included the complete observation. Typically, we avoid pointing ChemCam at the Sun (really, all cameras!), but this carefully designed observation will acquire ChemCam passive data that will characterize the spectral properties of the atmospheric dust kicked up by the dust storm. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot bad for a Monday!</p>"}, "2150": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2150-delivering-the-proper-portions", "text": "<p>The big question coming into today was whether to re-do the SAM analysis or not.

That will include dumping the rest of the material so we can see how much was left in the drill chambers. The operation will be carried out using two dozen separate portion drop-off sequences with Mastcam images in between to check how much material comes out. I just watched an animated video of the sequence and it looks pretty cool. The arm swings down near the ground for each drop-off, then moves out of the way, and the mast points Mastcam to take an image. Then the mast turns away-to avoid any possible dust-while the arm swings down for the next drop off. Every drop-off is done in a slightly different location on rock surfaces, some being spaced 7 mm away from each other around a circle. Each little portion gets imaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther activities planned for tosol include ChemCam bedrock target \"Papa Little\" and another ChemCam raster down the drill hole, with accompanying Mastcam documentation.

The distances between the first several holes might be too long for golf links on Earth, but maybe with reduced gravity and very little wind resistance, a mighty drive of over a kilometer might be possible.

Hydrogen atoms in water will reduce the energy of the neutrons, so the scattered signal that DAN receives will tell us about how much water might be present in the form of hydrated minerals and amorphous phases, to a depth of 1 m beneath the surface. Curiosity is using DAN multiple times today because the neutron output from the DAN Pulsing Neutron Generator (PNG) has decreased over time (though it is well beyond its expected life), and we hope that integrating over multiple intervals will give the same signal-to-noise ratio that DAN observations had at the start of Curiosity's mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, Curiosity is performing more analyses of the \"Stoer\" sample and continues to characterize the region around the drill site.

In today's plan, Curiosity will perform an evolved gas analysis (EGA) on the Stoer sample using the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument. EGA analyses are critical towards understanding the volatiles and organic molecules that may be present within the sample. SAM will heat the Stoer sample to very high temperatures, more than 900 degrees Celsius, and will measure the composition of gases (including H2O, CO2, and SO4) that bake out of the sample at each temperature increment. Many mineral species, including clays, sulfates, and carbonates, have diagnostic temperatures at which the volatile compounds are baked away. This EGA analysis will directly complement other chemical (e.g., APXS, ChemCam) and mineralogical (e.g., CheMin) analyses of the Stoer sample, and will be extremely important in understanding how the composition of this sample compares to others along the rover's traverse.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore these SAM EGA activities, however, there is enough spare power for the science team to conduct approximately one hour of targeted remote science. The activities added to this science block include several Mastcam images to monitor changes in small ripple patches near the rover, imaging of the rover deck to monitor the accumulation of wind-blown sand and dust, and multispectral images of two targets.

All evidence suggests that this rock target is one of the hardest yet observed in Gale crater, a property that may be indicative of this entire section of the Vera Rubin Ridge. To a geologist, variations in rock hardness could indicate several different physical and chemical properties about a rock. It is important for us to further characterize and understand why this rock unit is so much harder than the underlying rocks within the Murray formation. Could this increased hardness be related to changes in water chemistry as the sedimentary rocks were being deposited? Or, could this increased hardness be due to subsequent cementation as iron-rich water was injected into the previously deposited sedimentary rocks? In order to address these possible formation mechanisms (and countless others), we must continue to gather data on the physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of this portion of the Vera Rubin Ridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday's rover activities contain a combination of scientific investigations and engineering activities.

Many collaborators and I spent the winter and spring of 2012 -- the time between launch and landing -- working out the geological implications of this discovery as best we could using orbital data, and beginning to ponder the specific observations Curiosity should make when she reached the ridge. I first presented these findings to the Curiosity science team on sol 15 of the mission (or August 20, 2012 Earth time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost 2100 sols and countless exciting discoveries later, Curiosity is now poised to drill at the exact spot we first detected the strongest hematite signature over seven years ago.

Shortly after the Curiosity rover landed in 2012 I was asked to give a special talk to a very distinguished group of people. The slides had to be prepared a couple of weeks in advance and were sent from my director's office to be reviewed by handlers in the state where I was to give the talk. Those first days of the mission were breathtaking, and my presentation included the video of the landing, taken from the MARDI camera, mounted on belly of the rover, as it descended. In that scene, the dust gets kicked up by the sky crane's rocket engines as the rover nears the ground, and eventually the picture becomes rather dark as the rover's shadow covers the ground, but the first precious glimpse of a few pebbles can be made out, signaling a safe landing on an exciting new terrain!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in the middle of operations a couple of days after submitting the presentation when I noticed that I had just missed multiple phone calls. It turns out that the handler didn't like some parts of my presentation. Word was passed on to administrators at my institution: \"You have to get rid of that video--it just shows a bunch of dirt!\" I got on the phone and calmly explained that the offending sequence was in fact the very first Mars-landing video. My manager nearly fell off his chair laughing when he learned what it was. The person who didn't like the landing video probably would have equally disliked (or mistaken) a video of the first Moon landing, which also set down on \"just a bunch of dirt.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nTosol Curiosity's \"bunch of dirt\" is the dump pile consisting of drill tailings as seen in the MAHLI image above (roughly 16.3 by 12.2 cm in dimensions), and the tailings bunched around the drill hole itself. The rover starts its science activities with Mastcam and ChemCam passive multispectral observations of the dump pile, and Mastcam and ChemCam active interrogation of target \"Elbow Creek\" (a vein). The arm then moves MAHLI into position to get 25 and 5 cm close-ups of the drill hole and the surrounding tailings. In the evening MAHLI gets turned on again to do nighttime imaging of the CheMin inlet on the deck of the rover, and then it goes back to the surface for nighttime imaging of the drill hole. After that, APXS is placed in position on the dump pile for an overnight integration. In between these activities the rover will continue observing the dust and surroundings: Mastcam continues a change-detection series of daily observations of the nearby surface, as well as looking at the observation tray and getting a view out to the crater rim.

On Mars the rover basically has three-a UHF antenna that communicates with satellites orbiting Mars, a low-gain antenna (LGA) that does not need to be pointed but only handles a low data flow, and a high-gain antenna (HGA) that requires accurate knowledge of Earth's position to receive or send commands directly. The two antennae on the left side of the rover are shown in the image above, taken early in the mission. The LGA is the pointy object near the left, and the HGA is the paddle-shaped object near the center of the image. The UHF antenna (not shown) is a can-shaped object on the back right side of the rover. Over the weekend the HGA was left unavailable to receive commands due to an error during a test, so the team had to do the next best thing yestersol, skipping most of the normal plan in order to reset the HGA-a bit like someone on Earth having to resort to a text message on an intermittent cell connection when an hours-long conversation was desired. As of today, it looks like Curiosity is back on track with normal communications. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust to continue the discussion, on the downlink side, thanks to the combination of the HGA, orbiting satellites, and the Deep Space Network on Earth, we have received an average of about 60 megabytes of data each day from Curiosity over the last several years. We take that data link for granted when all is working well!<br/>\n<br/>\nBack on the ground, Curiosity is resuming its drill-related activities with the plan to dump the tailings that are remaining in the drill. The sample dump is scheduled to take place in the early afternoon. Afterwards, the dump pile will be observed by Mastcam and MAHLI, and APXS will do an overnight integration on the pile. These analyses allow the rover team to determine the chemical composition of the drill material for comparison with the mineral composition obtained by CheMin. Having both chemical and mineral compositions helps us understand the origin of the rock and the conditions prevailing at the time of its formation much better than one data set by itself. Also happening during the day: ChemCam will shoot a couple of unrelated targets, \"Robinson Lake\" (nearby pebbles) and \"Tofte\" (a vein), both of which will also be observed by Mastcam.

Then we'll take a Mastcam image of the crater rim to determine line-of-sight extinction, which is directly related to the amount of dust present.

But last Friday was not just your typical good day -- it was a very, very, very good day. In my personal opinion, it was probably one of the top five most excellent planning days we've had on the mission to date. Early Friday morning we learned that the Feed Extended Sample Transfer (FEST) drop-off of the \"Duluth\" drill sample to CheMin worked. This means we had enough rock powder in the instrument to measure its mineralogy. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, now that we've demonstrated this critical step on Mars, the team can officially say that Curiosity's drilling and sample transfer capabilities have been restored.

This is exposed Murray formation bedrock, so the purpose is to compare its chemical composition with other Murray targets and get a sense of their variability. Also included were Mastcam stereo images of targets \"Anderson Lake,\" \"Bob Lake,\" \"Toohey Lake,\" and \"Bass Lake\" to better understand the bedding geometry.

Such overlap is ideal, because rapid pressure drops measured with REMS - which indicate a convective vortex (dusty or not!) passing nearby - can then be correlated with any dust devils we spot in the movies. This tells us something about how intense vortex activity has to be to raise dust and make vortices visible as dust devils. And on the rare occasions when we can connect a REMS pressure drop to a specific dust devil, we can use this to learn more about the dust devil's size and speed.</p>"}, "2067": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2067-tis-the-season-to-be-dusty", "text": "<p>The previous plan included some tests of the sample delivery system, including delivery of a single portion to the closed cover of the SAM inlet.

This is a very exciting time for us on the rover team, who have been waiting for quite a while to successfully drill into a target and to ingest samples into the rover's analytical instruments. Before we are able to use all of our instruments, however, we must first characterize the nature of the materials that were collected during the drill activities. So, on Monday, the science team planned for the characterization of three small portions of the collected sample that were to be dropped onto the surface in front of us so that we could image these materials at high resolution. While these efforts were not primarily driven by science (the rover engineers were more interested in the nature of the sample and whether there would be any difficulties in delivering the sample to Curiosity's instruments), the science team didn't dare miss an opportunity to make some cool measurements of the new materials in front of us!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst up in Monday's plan was multispectral imaging of the drill target and some regular visible imaging of a small patch of sand ripples named \"Esko.\" The drill target observation was requested to help determine how the interior of the Duluth target differs from its surface, while the imaging of Esko was used to see if there is any motion of the Esko ripples over time. ChemCam was then used to passively image the drill hole, and then to actively characterize the chemistry of the drill hole and drill tailings using its laser instrument. Mastcam and ChemCam imaging capabilities were also used to acquire high-resolution images of the small test portions throughout the plan. The next day's science plan had two Mastcam observations - one of the small portions and one of the Esko ripples - both of which were designed to identify whether the wind had modified these surfaces at all.

ChemCam will shoot three targets to learn more about the chemistry of the layers within the Duluth block and similar blocks around it. Within the Duluth block, ChemCam will target \"Chisholm,\" the delicate layer curling up above the top of the Duluth block, and \"Aitkin,\" another layer jutting out from the side of the block. The \"Buhl\" target sits off to the rover's right and represents another example of the Blunts Point member for ChemCam to sample. Mastcam will then image two large blocks dubbed \"Kabetogama\" to learn more about the intricate layering of the Blunts Point member. Before drilling, Curiosity will also give the sky some attention.

Their ability to work around the problem from afar and give us another chance at drilling is very much in the spirit of NASA's engineers designing fixes to the systems of Apollo 13 as the spacecraft hurtled, crippled, to the Moon. Although the stakes are different for MSL, the ingenuity is the same. The science team has been wondering what minerals might be responsible for the layers, veins and nodules in the Blunts Point rocks. A successful drill will mark the first step in answering that mystery. Suffice it to say, the whole MSL team - scientists and engineers - will be waiting with bated breath for the data that reveal if the drilling was successful.

But, as the team likes one-word names, we are just calling the drill site \"Duluth.\" The name was almost changed yesterday when it was realized that \"Duluth\" was already used for a ChemCam target on Sol 292. Normally we don't use names more than once, but the team decided an exception was warranted. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuluth, my birth city, was at one time the busiest port in the United States in terms of gross tonnage, surpassing even New York for a while. It is still considered the largest freshwater port in the world even though it is one of the farthest inland, at 3770 km from the Atlantic Ocean. Duluth has one of the coolest climates in the US due to its proximity to the world's largest and one of the deepest freshwater lakes. The drill target \"Duluth\" on Mars was also once near the shore of a large freshwater lake. Its climate is also relatively cool, so the name is apropos. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Curiosity rover is commencing its drill sequence with a full suite of contact science characterizations today. It will start with a touch of the target by the arm just off to the side of the planned drill site (documented by Hazcam and Navcam), then an APXS observation and then MAHLI observations of the \"Duluth\" target at 25 cm. After that there will be a pre-load drill test, which will be documented by the imagers. MAHLI will image the site at 35 cm along with imaging the location where the arm did its touch. The Dust Removal Tool (DRT) will brush the target, after which Mastcam will inspect the brush and the brushed surface, and MAHLI will document the brushed target at 25, 5, and 1-2 cm distances. The 5 cm distance will support a stereo pair of images. APXS will be placed for an overnight observation of the target. Navcam and Hazcam will document most of the arm instrument positions over the course of the day. Mastcam will take a Phobos transit video near sunset.

So, the team was planning to spend a full day at this location to perform remote science investigations, to brush off a rock surface, to analyze the surface's chemistry with the APXS instrument, and to take some high-resolution oblique images to characterize the layering observed in the sides of the rocks. When the team woke up this morning and first saw the workspace in front of the rover, everyone was happy and eager to get to work!<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a stroke of bad luck prevented the science team from performing most of these analyses. About half-way through planning this work, the science team got news that the rover was not only sitting at a rather steep angle (~17 degrees relative to horizontal), but that one of the wheels was also propped up on a loose rock. In order to play it safe and to minimize any risk that the rover would lose its balance when the arm was extended to perform many of these analyses, the rover planners and the science team decided to forego any arm activities and, instead, plan only a short science investigation and to \"bump\" to a nearby rock to try again tomorrow for a full surface characterization. While these decisions are momentarily disappointing, they are relatively frequent and necessary to ensure that Curiosity will be able to perform her job many years into the future.

The rover is positioned on a rock-strewn sandy slope, and the science team thought the scattered rocks of the workspace would be better interrogated with Mastcam and ChemCam than MAHLI and APXS. ChemCam targeted \"Virginia,\" a tan bedrock slab with small nodules, \"Shannon Lake,\" a red bedrock slab, and \"Eveleth,\" a block with distinctive layers.

Besides being long, this drive was remarkable because it marked a shift in Curiosity's strategic campaign: we have officially finished our initial reconnaissance of Vera Rubin Ridge, and we are beginning our journey down off the ridge, heading north into an area where we would like to test the rover's drill. The guidance from the team is now \"drive, drive, drive!,\" while still doing as much opportunistic science as we can along the way of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the sol 2027 drive, we have also officially entered the Biwabik Quad. You may recall we flirted with the boundary of this quad back on sol 2004-2007 and <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2013-from-biwabik-back-to-torridon\">2009-2012</a>. Biwabik is a city in the United States in northern Minnesota that is connected with the Mesabi Range. This range contains a vast iron deposit, so we felt it was a perfect choice for the hematite-rich area we are currently exploring. (Hematite is an iron-rich mineral). Entering a new quad means we have a fresh set of target names to choose from, which added some fun to our morning planning. One of the names we chose, \"Babbitt,\" is named after a city of ~1,500 residents about 30 miles away from Biwabik. Our Flagstaff-based team members also liked this name because it was reminiscent of the famous Babbitt Brothers who made a name for themselves as cattle ranchers in Flagstaff Arizona in the early 1900s. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe planned 3-sols today. In the first sol, we will have a morning remote sensing block with ChemCam observations of rock targets \"Ely,\" Babbitt, and \"Hibbing.\" These observations will be accompanied by Mastcam documentation images. We will also take a Mastcam mosaic and some multispectral frames of a nearby crater, and we have named this feature \"Taconite.\" The remote sensing block will be followed by MAHLI and APXS observations of Babbitt. In the second sol of the plan, we will take a morning dust devil movie and use MAHLI to look at our wheels and document any punctures that may have formed over the last few hundred meters of driving. This will be followed by short drive along our strategic route with post-drive imaging activities that will set us up for a touch and go on Monday. The third sol of the plan is all about monitoring the Martian environment. We will take an overnight measurement with APXS to understand the Argon abundance in the atmosphere (it varies seasonally), and spend the morning taking a zenith movie, horizon movie, crater rim extinction imaging, and tau measurement. We will also use the ChemCam instrument in passive mode to take a spectrum on the atmosphere around noon.

Quite a feat, considering Curiosity's primary mission was designed to last just one Mars year. Yet another reason why the engineers and rover and science planners are invaluable to our exploration of the Red Planet!<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of some power-intensive measurements that will take place later in the evening (see below), today's surface investigations will be fairly lean and will last just over one hour. Curiosity did not drive either yesterday or today, so we are still in the same location where we are hoping to identify the sources and nature of the strong iron oxide signatures observed from orbit. To start our investigation, we will be imaging the nearby surface to investigate how the observed iron oxide signatures change as a function of changes in solar illumination. This type of experiment and material behavior is known as \"photometry,\" and spectroscopists can learn quite a bit about surface properties based on these types of measurements. We will then acquire Mastcam multispectral images of the landscape in front of the rover where we will be investigating over the subsequent week to determine how the mineral signatures vary over the landscape. After these imaging efforts, we will use the ChemCam instrument to investigate the chemistry of local rock targets in front of the rover. The first target (named \"Burntisland\") is a red piece of rock that was disturbed by one of Curiosity's wheels whose color suggests the presence of the iron oxides that we're looking to investigate. The second target (named \"Burghead\") is a more purple piece of bedrock in front of the rover that was also disturbed by a rover wheel. This measurement will help us to determine the full range of compositional variations observed throughout the workspace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter these science investigations, Curiosity will use two different instruments (Sample Analysis at Mars, or SAM, and the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer, or APXS) to measure the concentration of argon in the martian atmosphere. Argon is the third most abundant gas in the martian atmosphere, accounting for nearly 2% by volume. Previous studies have shown that the concentration of argon is able to change seasonally in the martian atmosphere, and so the SAM and APXS instruments will be monitoring its current abundance to understand if/how the concentration of argon has been variable over time. These measurements utilize a fair amount of energy, which is why the scientific observations in today's plan are relatively short.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will continue to investigate the variations in iron oxide signatures across the Vera Rubin Ridge over the next few weeks, but the activities over the past and subsequent few days are of critical importance due to the strong signatures observed from orbit.

Is there a way to know before starting the drill hole how hard the rock will be, so we can anticipate whether Curiosity's new drill technique will be successful?\" It turns out that the rover team has several indicators of rock hardness: a) retention of natural features such as craters, b) the imprints of wheel marks on the rocks, when we see them, c) scratch marks from the DRT brush, and d) laser pits from ChemCam. This turns out to be a lot of data, especially from ChemCam and MAHLI. However, no one has yet made a quantitative study of rock hardness vs. apparent laser pit depth or brush scratches. The problem is that other factors can affect how deep the pit or scratches look in our images, especially including lighting angle and rock texture and color, but also, for the laser, the distance from the rover and the focus quality. Even so, a study to determine apparent laser pit depth or scratch depth vs. hardness may be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe classic Mohs mineral hardness scale was developed over 200 years ago, based on ten readily available minerals ranging from talc (hardness of 1) to diamond (hardness of 10). It is still used because of its simplicity-you can buy a kit with each of the representative minerals and try using them to scratch the mineral that you want to test. However, for quantitative measurements, most studies use the Vickers scale, which was defined 100 years ago and is reported in kg per square mm. It is traditionally measured by the size of the indentation left from a diamond tip with a given force applied.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back on Mars, Curiosity will be driving away from this hard-rock location, with the first drive since Sol 1962, planned to go backwards for 30 meters in a northeasterly direction.

The first round of MAHLI imaging of both the pre-sieve and post-sieve samples, dumped into separate piles in the workspace, was successful over the weekend, as was the APXS analysis of the post-sieve pile. In today's plan, MAHLI will return to both dump piles for closer approach images to better resolve the fine sand particles in each pile, and APXS will analyze the pre-sieve dump pile. ChemCam will get a turn at the dump piles, acquiring reflectance spectra from the pre-sieve dump pile and a raster over the post-sieve dump pile. ChemCam is kind enough to wait to shoot the dump piles until MAHLI and APXS look closely at them so the pile is not blasted away by the laser!

This was primarily driven by the large suite of excellent science targets available in the workspace. These targets continue to help constrain the geologic story of the Vera Rubin Ridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo arm targets for APXS integrations were quickly chosen by the science team and handed off to the Rover Planners for assessment (\"Ross of Mull\" and \"Mcleans Nose\"). \"Ross of Mull\" is a grayer bedrock area with nodular material nearby, while \"Mcleans Nose\" is a prominent gray toned resistant feature. ChemCam data was acquired of a suite of targets, including those that had the elongate, raised, linear features known by the team as \"sticks\", as well as the two APXS targets.

Sharp. This is an anomalous amount of data to collect at a given time, but we are able to do so thanks to the help of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN) spacecraft, which will be helping us to downlink those images over the course of the next week.

The first will be \"Canna,\" a knobby piece of bedrock, and the second will be \"Aberfoyle,\" the flattest portion of this blocky region in front of the rover. Aberfoyle will also be the target of an APXS measurement that evening. Mastcam will be used to document these targets, in addition to the automated ChemCam observation that was obtained two days earlier. The \"Aberfoyle\" ChemCam observation is beneficial for two reasons. First, we will be acquiring additional chemical measurements of this target that will be analyzed with APXS. Second, the laser blasts of ChemCam will help to remove any surface dust on the target, which will allow APXS to more confidently measure the bedrock composition with minimal input from the fine-grained dust. After this suite of measurements, the arm will then be moved into position to image the \"Canna\" target, the \"Aberfoyle\" target, and also a nearby layerred rock named \"Funzie.\" After these images are acquired, the APXS instrument will be placed on \"Aberfoyle\" for an overnight integration.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the final day of the plan, ChemCam will analyze the chemistry of the \"Unst\" target (which was analyzed by APXS on the first evening of the plan), the \"Funzie\" target (to determine if there are any compositional variations associated with the observed layers), and a new target named \"Morar,\" which is a piece of bedrock that shows some unique patterns that might be due to fracturing, the presence of veins, and/or sculpting by the wind.

In addition, while Curiosity has spent the last several weeks progressing largely to the south, the team has started to command Curiosity to head more towards the east, doglegging left along the nominal Mt. Sharp Ascent Route (MSAR). Over the next few days, the plan is for Curiosity to investigate what appears to be a small eroded impact crater as well as an erosional window into some visually distinct bedrock outcrops.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore reaching these targets, Curiosity will conduct some additional investigations of the VRR and the local blocky materials. Sol 1895 has a 1.5 hour block of time dedicated to remote observations of the surrounding terrain. Curiosity will begin with some Mastcam color images of two interesting targets in front of the rover: a blocky exposure of fractured bedrock (named \"Mapedi\") and a nodular piece of bedrock (named \"Koonap\"). Afterwards, ChemCam will make active LIBS measurements on three bedrock targets (named \"Naute,\" \"Mzamba,\" and \"Nauga,\" located above the shadow of Curiosity's mast in the provided Navcam image) that are different in tone than other dusty materials in front of the rover, followed by a Mastcam documentation image of this target area.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing these measurements, Curiosity's arm will be unfurled and she will acquire high-resolution MAHLI images of the Mzamba target in addition to an overnight APXS analysis to derive the rock's bulk chemistry. The next day, before heading towards the eroded impact crater, Curiosity will stow her arm in preparation for the ~1 hour drive to the east. Following her drive, Curiosity will undertake the standard post-drive imaging sequence in addition to acquiring a MARDI image to document the terrain immediately under the rover's belly.<br/>\n<br/>\nRandom Fact of the Day: One of today's ChemCam targets is named \"Naute,\" which is the name of a dam in Namibia along a tributary of the Fish River. Namibia's Fish River Canyon is the largest canyon in Africa, and is a widely visited tourist attraction for its scenic views. The Fish River Canyon is also home to an annual ultra marathon (100 km distance) that travels through the difficult terrain along the margins of the river.

We had such a decision to make today as some of the most interesting rocks near our planned stop in the Vera Rubin Ridge science campaign were a short distance away. So, we weighed whether to drive a short distance this weekend and study those rocks next week (delaying our existing plans for next week by several days at least), or be content with the rocks we are parked near and drive onward (stopping just left of the small ridge in the foreground <a href=\"https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_565366193EDR_F0670604NCAM00257M_&amp;s=1891\">at the upper right of this image</a>) to our next destination on the Vera Rubin Ridge. We chose the latter option after determining that these nearby rock targets are sufficiently similar to those a few short meters away and knowing we'll have future opportunities to study some of these bluish-toned rocks at future stops.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that decision made, Curiosity will be conducting contact science with APXS and MAHLI on two rocks (\"Drakensberg\" and \"Strubenkop\") on the first sol of our 3-sol weekend plan. The contact science will be complemented by ChemCam LIBS and Mastcam images on those same rocks and two additional rock targets (\"Pongola\" and \"Third White Ash\"). Fittingly, \"Third White Ash\" is a bright white rock seemingly embedded in the otherwise gravely surface we are driving over. On the third sol of our plan, ENV has a full day of monitoring the skies over Gale Crater for clouds (it's the cloudy time of year on Mars right now) and dust devils, and Curiosity will drive toward our next stop along the Vera Rubin Ridge.</p>"}, "1891": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1891-making-do-with-what-you-got", "text": "<p>Even before we started planning today's activities, we knew there would be a chance that we would be limited on the amount of data returned to Earth following the previous drive. This turned out to be true, as a data relay from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter did not make it down to JPL in time for us to have full Navcam imaging coverage of the area surrounding the rover and in the drive direction. Fortunately, the limited data availability did not significantly influence our capabilities for the day, which is a true testament to the science team, rover planners, and everyone involved in the daily operations!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the data that are available do not show great bedrock exposures, and because utilizing Curiosity's arm would have likely required all of the data to be downlinked, the science team decided to focus on remote analyses in the immediate vicinity of the rover and then to hit the road for our next stop on Vera Rubin Ridge. The science plan includes long-distance remote imaging with the ChemCam instrument, as well as a Mastcam calibration image and documentation of the automatically selected ChemCam active target executed in the previous plan. Mastcam will also take a multispectral image of the region where Curiosity will be headed over the next few days, in an effort to fully characterize the spectral diversity of this location and to compare with orbital remote sensing data.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity will then continue her drive to the southeast, headed for a unique patch of terrain that appears interesting in high-resolution orbital data. The hope is to reach this unit on this drive, as that will allow the science team to investigate this interesting region over the duration of the weekend's plan. Because we didn't receive the Navcam data necessary for the rover planners to fully plan the drive, Curiosity will undertake a \"guarded drive,\" where she will autonomously assess the safety of the path ahead and stop the drive if necessary. This is one of those options that is only made available to the mission thanks to the incredible skills of the rover planners and those who developed the mobility software! Following her drive, Curiosity will take her standard sequence of post-drive imaging for targeting, ChemCam will automatically acquire data from a nearby bedrock target, and Mastcam and Navcam will both make environmental and atmospheric observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is only a one-sol plan, as tomorrow is a \"soliday\" on Mars.

Instead of a turkey, Curiosity will be cooking a sample of \"Ogunquit Beach\" in the SAM EGA oven.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that happens, we'll use MARDI to look at the ground under the rover to see if anything has moved while we have been sitting at this location. Then, pre-dawn on sol 1883 ChemCam will analyze the rock target \"Lebombo\" and the soil \"Oaktree\" to look for evidence of frost. Then, on sol 1885 we have a whole bunch of side dishes in the form of remote sensing. Mastcam will collect multispectral observations of the target \"Hexriver\" and ChemCam will analyze the targets \"Klipfonteinheuwel\" and \"Klippan.\" I also advocated for ChemCam to use the RMI to take a closer look at an interesting geologic contact on Mt. Sharp. Mastcam will document all of the ChemCam observations, as well as the ChemCam auto-targeted observation from sol 1878. Mastcam will repeat its clast survey observation from a few days ago to check for any changes, and then APXS will analyze Klippan and Klipfonteinheuwel overnight. Before dawn on sol 1886 ChemCam will once again analyze Lebombo and Oaktree to look for frost and Navcam and Mastcam will take advantage of the early start to make some atmospheric observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second plan for the long weekend covers sols 1886 through 1888. Mastcam will take pictures of the two frost campaign targets, as well as another atmospheric observation. Then ChemCam and Mastcam will take another look at the AEGIS target from sol 1878. This target was given the name \"Reivilo\" by two of our French colleagues who were on operations today, both named Olivier, who really like the name for some reason. After that, MAHLI will take a closer look at Klipfonteinheuwel and Klippan and APXS will do an overnight calibration measurement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn sol 1887 Curiosity will finally move on from this spot where we have been camped for a while, collecting some post-drive images to help with targeting next week. Finally, we have an untargeted science block. ChemCam will use AEGIS to automatically pick another target, and we will attempt another one of my observations of Mt. Sharp with the RMI, this time to check for changes on a distant mesa that I have been monitoring. We will wrap up our long weekend with Navcam observations to check for clouds and dust devils, and Mastcam observations to measure the dust in the atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe on the Curiosity team are thankful every day that we get to be a part of the exploration of Mars, and next week we'll pick up where we left off as we continue our campaign to explore Vera Rubin Ridge!</p>"}, "1879": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-1879-1881-stay-frosty", "text": "<p>Today's three-sol plan was all about picking interesting targets to explore at our Thanksgiving stopover point, including setting up for our winter 'frost detection' experiments, and getting SAM ready to do some power-hungry analysis while we stay put. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe're only a few sols from southern winter solstice in Gale Crater on Mars, which means it's pretty much the coldest time of year and the best time for Curiosity to try to see water frost on the surface. If we see frost formation, this provides a lot of information for atmospheric scientists like me, who can use it to test models of when and how much frost should form on different types of surfaces, and to better understand how atmospheric water interacts with the surface and subsurface. The problem is that, even in winter, the temperatures in Gale only <em>just</em> dip below the frost point and then only <em>right</em> before dawn. Also, when we've tried looking in previous years, we seem to have been unlucky: the last time we looked for winter frost, the experiment ran on what turned out to be the warmest night of the week. But this just means we have to stay alert to have a good chance of seeing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started today by picking two targets: a small, smooth-topped sand patch, \"Oaktree,\" which sits in a kind of rock circle toward the upper right edge of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRB_564134833EDR_F0670000NCAM00354M_&amp;s=1877\">this Navcam image</a> just before the darker material begins; and a small rock with an east-facing slope, \"Lebombo.\" The sand should have a lower thermal inertia than rock, which means that it cools down more overnight and may be more likely to form frost. But porous sand can also tend to adsorb water instead of the water freezing on its top. So we also chose a rock target with an east-facing slope so it's in shadow for as much of the afternoon as possible, which means it should be able to cool down a little more than other rocks overnight. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we only expect the frost layer at this location to be a few microns thick, and to vanish rapidly when temperatures start going up at dawn, it's very hard to detect with cameras. So we'll be using the ChemCam instrument and its Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) to vaporize the top few microns of the surface at night and look for extra hydrogen in the signal, then compare this to daytime measurements of a similar location on the same target.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'll be making the daytime hydrogen measurements first, on Sol 1879, then in the next plan we'll include nighttime measurements just before dawn on Sols 1883 and 1886, and keep our fingers crossed for seeing a big increase in the hydrogen signal on at least one of the targets! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs well as the frost preparations, our new location stood out from a distance as having lots of color variety in <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=1873ML0098010020703411E01_DXXX&amp;s=1873\">Mastcam images</a>, and we were able to access both brighter and darker blocks with the arm. So in today's plan we'll also be brushing bright target \"Hexriver\" to remove the top dust layer with the DRT before ChemCam and APXS are done, but the dark target \"Zululand\" was too small so no brushing will happen first. Meanwhile, Mastcam will be providing imaging of these targets, as well as documenting more of the light-gray/blue rocks that drew us here (target \"Natal\") and the contrast between the bright and dark toned units on target \"Kansa.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'll be making our usual REMS, RAD, and DAN measurements of the environment, with some additional cloud and sky movies with Navcam and Mastcam just before sunset on Sol 1880 to get a better idea of the aerosols - dust and water ice - around during the frost experiments.

As the surface properties scientist (SPS) on shift today, I worked closely with the rover planners to pick a drive target that had the highest likelihood of leaving the rover in a good, stable position while still giving us an exciting workspace for future contact science. In the end, we decided to try to head for an area where we see two different colors of rocks - the typical tan rocks that have been present throughout our time on the ridge as well as some grayer rocks that appear to be unique to the upper part of the ridge.

In the next few days Curiosity will drive over this contact between the lighter-toned, lower unit and the darker-toned, upper unit of the Vera Rubin Ridge.

MAHLI will image both Barberton (a patch of bedrock with a rough, nodular texture) and Campbellrand, a smooth patch of Vera Rubin Ridge bedrock at night using her white light LEDs to illuminate the target. The choice of night imaging was driven by the poor workspace illumination expected at the more-typical daytime imaging times. When Curiosity is parked facing eastern headings, as she was today, the rover arm and body cast shadows on the workspace in front of the rover. Shadows across MAHLI images make it more challenging to see the color and texture of the targets. MAHLI's white light LEDs are not quite bright enough to use during the day to fill in these shadows, but in the dark of night, they illuminate targets brightly, giving the team an unfettered look at their rocks of interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nAPXS will analyze Barberton using their raster technique. In a raster, APXS is placed at multiple spots, each slightly offset from one another, over a target that is hypothesized to have at least two different chemical components. In the case of Barberton, these two different components are the background bedrock and the material producing the nodular texture. The slightly different spots measured by APXS yield slightly different chemistries. By using the MAHLI images that accompany each APXS analysis to determine how much of each component is within each spot, the chemistry of the components can be separated from one another. Barberton chemistry will also be probed by ChemCam before MAHLI and APXS look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMastcam had many new features and structures to look at even just 25 m away from our last stop. South and east of Curiosity were two prime mosaic targets: bedrock exposures identified from orbit, which proved even more interesting on the ground. Stereo imaging of both these areas will allow the team to measure the bedding orientations in this part of the Vera Rubin Ridge, perhaps gaining more clues to its origin. Mastcam will also turn her <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/martian-ridge-brings-out-rovers-color-talents/\">filters on one of these bedrock areas</a> to probe its iron mineralogy.

Even yesterday, the team discovered an error with the left Mastcam data transfer that has marked the instrument temporarily SICK and is preventing us from acquiring new data from it until sometime after this weekend's plan. Nonetheless, the team is optimistic moving into the weekend, and has planned a really nice suite of observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity will try one more time to deliver Ogunquit Beach sample to the SAM instrument, and SAM will hopefully perform an evolved gas analysis (EGA) on the sample overnight on the first evening of this weekend's plan. Curiosity will spend the majority of the following day (Saturday) sleeping and recharging, as the EGA analyses require significant power to perform. Towards the end of that day, Curiosity will image and brush a patch of flat bedrock in front of the rover named \"Sibasa\" and will analyze this patch of bedrock with the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument to accurately characterize the chemistry of this region. This will be an overnight measurement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday, Curiosity will spend two hours investigating her surroundings with Mastcam images as well as ChemCam laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements. ChemCam will analyze four separate targets: \"Schmidtsdrif,\" \"Sibasa,\" \"Lisbon,\" and \"Estecourt.\" Schmidtsdrif is a potentially hematite-rich target that is similar to iron-rich targets identified earlier this week. Sibasa is the brushed and imaged target that was also analyzed using the APXS instrument. Lisbon is a patch of dark soil near the rover. Estecourt is a raised block of material that is also similar to a previous sol's target, and these analyses will hopefully allow for comparisons between targets.<br/>\n<br/>\nMastcam imaging will not only document these ChemCam targets, but will also be used to acquire additional images further away from the rover to inspect the nature of the Vera Rubin Ridge from this location, and to help us plan for future traverses. As the left Mastcam instrument is currently unavailable, all imaging will be done with Mastcam's right \"eye.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all of the headaches that arose this week, the science team and rover planners have managed to again arrange for some wonderful science to be done with the resources that are currently available. On Monday, we will hopefully have accomplished a successful EGA analysis on Ogunquit Beach, will have used the APXS instrument to characterize Sibasa, and will have a plethora of new Mastcam and ChemCam observations to understand this section of the Vera Rubin Ridge. Hopefully all of your weekends will be more relaxing than Curiosity's!</p>"}, "1856": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1856-1857-take-two-almost", "text": "<p>After Monday's communications hiccup (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1853-54-space-is-hard\">detailed here</a>) that prevented us from uplinking our two-sol plan, today we're hoping to redo most of what we had in Monday's plan. This primarily includes a remote science block, during which we'll shoot a few ChemCam targets named \"Hartley,\" \"Hooggenoeg,\" and \"Beaufort\" to study nearby pebbles and bedrock. We'll also look behind us to take some Mastcam mosaics of Aeolis Palus, the Gale crater plains to the north of Mount Sharp. We'll take some additional Mastcam images to document local bedrock features as well as the Vera Rubin Ridge terrain just in front of the rover.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe originally planned to do a SAM analysis of our stored \"Ogunquit Beach\" sand sample, but we came across a late breaking issue that caused us to remove the activity from the plan.

This is unlike the landscape in the Murray formation at the base of the ridge, which was dominated by a combination of bedrock exposures and wind-mobilized sands. However, following Curiosity's drive two days ago, the team found a local landscape dominated by <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_561562205EDR_F0661654NCAM00312M_&amp;s=1848\">small cobbles and pebbles</a> with an abundance of fine soil surrounding these fragments. We had planned to investigate this location based on both ground- and satellite-based observations due to its different appearance relative to the rest of VRR, but this was our first up-close glimpse of this different landscape.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe science team had a few decisions to make during today's planning session. There was time available to use the MAHLI (high-resolution imaging) and APXS (bulk chemistry) instruments located on Curiosity's arm to investigate the surroundings, and the team was able to choose to perform either a quick \"touch and go\" analysis (where we are able to drive away the same day as making the measurements) or a more detailed contact science investigation, where APXS would be used overnight and we would stay in the same location for a few days. Each option has pros and cons (including the number of targets that could be analyzed, the amount of driving that we can do in the near future, etc.), so the team started the day with this detailed discussion of these options and the geologic targets in front of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith such a heterogeneous landscape in front of us, there was a concern that APXS measurements (which have a large footprint relative to the pebbles in the workspace) would be difficult to interpret (i.e., determining which pebble(s) or soil are contributing to the chemical signatures), so the team decided to forgo any APXS measurements and instead use the finer-scale ChemCam chemistry measurements to characterize the observed heterogeneity. Curiosity will also analyze the landscape using multispectral Mastcam observations, which can provide additional information about the observed compositional diversity. This will allow the rover to drive off later that same day without the need to stick around. Once this decision was made, the science team then took to selecting targets of interest to analyze.<br/>\n<br/>\nChemCam will analyze two locations near the rover to determine the compositional variability. The first target, \"Blinkberg,\" is a pebble-rich region near the rover, and ChemCam will be used to measure several pebbles and soil patches surrounding this target. Investigation of the second target, \"Wolkberg,\" will consist of measuring a larger clast and the surrounding soils. These observations will hopefully inform the team about any compositional variability observed in the pebbles that are strewn about the region.<br/>\n<br/>\nMastcam will then take over to acquire high-resolution imaging and multispectral observations. Mastcam will first turn to imaging the horizon just south of the rover, towards a region of interest for studying the nature and structure of the VRR. Next, Mastcam will image the \"Blinkberg\" ChemCam target and the surrounding area using all of its multispectral filters, which will help to characterize any observed compositional variations. Then, Mastcam will perform a similar observation of the \"Wolkberg\" ChemCam target and the surrounding region known as \"Zeederberg.\" Curiosity's arm will then be unfurled, and she will use the MAHLI high-resolution imager to investigate the \"Blinkberg\" target, hopefully helping to constrain the grain size of the pebbles and sediments in the acquired scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this region has been extensively studied, Curiosity will continue her drive towards the south. Following this drive, Curiosity will document her surroundings using her navigation cameras, Mastcam will image the surroundings to characterize the nearby soils and rock clasts as well as imaging the rover deck, and ChemCam will make an automated chemistry observation of nearby bedrock and will calibrate its imaging system.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday's science planning was a great example of how \"nimble\" the science team can be. The team started its discussion with several options on the table and was able to quickly assess the rover's surroundings and make the best decision possible to analyze these surroundings, keeping the broader scientific objectives and goals in mind. It's often said that getting scientists to agree with each other is comparable to \"herding cats,\" but today was certainly not one of those days!</p>"}, "1848": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-1848-1849-how-far-weve-come", "text": "<p>Today felt like any other planning day: a straightforward plan involving remote sensing, a drive, post-drive imaging, and some untargeted observations on the second sol. Just a typical day in the office. Maybe even an easy one. It wasn't until I sat down to write this blog that I fully processed how far we've come and just how awesome Curiosity's \"office\" is. I was looking through the drive imagery and came across this Navcam frame (posted above), which looks down on the Murray Buttes and Bagnold Dune Field, across Aeolis Palus and the northern rim of Gale crater. It's pretty spectacular to see just how much we've explored in 5 years.

We came in to assess how the weekend activities completed, what targets we had in front of us, and which route we wanted to take to get to the next interesting feature on Vera Rubin Ridge. The two-sol plan begins with a preload test of the rover's drill. Then Curiosity will acquire ChemCam and Mastcam observations of some nodular purple bedrock (target \"Buck Reef\"), and a unique gray-white vein or clast (target \"Boomplaas\"). We also planned some Mastcam imaging of sedimentary structures exposed in cross-section (target \"Eccles\") and to document the previously-acquired ChemCam AEGIS target. Then Curiosity will drive ~15-20 m further south to investigate some mottled outcrop that we first noticed from orbit. After the drive, we'll take Mastcam and Navcam images to prepare for contact science in the next plan. Data volume was a challenge today, so we had to think carefully about which images we need to have down in time to make decisions on Wednesday. On the second sol, Curiosity will wake up early to acquire a number of environmental monitoring observations to monitor clouds, dust, and wind. Later on the second sol we planned another ChemCam AEGIS observation to automatically target bedrock in our new location.

This reduces the amount of electricity we have to conduct science, but we were still able to prepare a full plan for the next two sols. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe identified two new bedrock targets to analyze with ChemCam (\"Woodlands\" and \"Montecristo\", which are near the bottom portion of this image: <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_560929716EDR_F0661332NCAM00279M_&amp;s=1841\">https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_560929716EDR_F0661332NCAM00279M_&amp;s=1841</a>).

Her right rear wheel encountered a small ridge (part of which is visible to the right of the wheel in the above image), a few inches of rock offering just enough resistance to cause Curiosity to stop the drive and wait for further instructions. The unexpected obstacle gave Curiosity a fourth planning sol at this location which the team used to add to their collection of bedrock measurements from the workspace. The \"Bulawayo\" target offered one of the least-dusty surfaces in the workspace, a gray, finely-layered and vertical rock face that made a tempting target for ChemCam. ChemCam also shot \"Bushveld,\" a wind-sculpted expanse of bedrock dotted with small, resistant features. Not far from Bushveld, and adjacent to Sol 1838's \"Duitschland\" target, both MAHLI and APXS studied bedrock target \"Stormberg.\" Having APXS analyses from both Stormberg and Duitschland in close proximity provides the opportunity to tease out small chemical differences between the targets. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter freeing herself from the obstacle by the right rear wheel, Curiosity will drive ~20 m farther up the \"Vera Rubin Ridge.\" Post-drive, she'll acquire an automatically-targeted ChemCam analysis and a third CheMin integration of the \"Ogunquit Beach\" sand sample.

Bokkeveld is a \"typical\" bedrock target, which will help us to understand just how different Buffalo Spring is relative to more typical basaltic targets. Later that afternoon, Curiosity will undergo some additional drill diagnostics to assess all of the great work that the engineers have been doing to get the drill capabilities back to the science team.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly the following morning, the Navcam cameras will be used to identify and monitor local clouds. Around midday, ChemCam will make an automated measurement of a nearby rocky target as well as its titanium calibration target, and the Navcam cameras will image the surroundings and search for local dust devils.

Due to limited power for today's plan (thanks to some power-hungry SAM observations), that's just about all that made it in from a remote sensing perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we did get a couple of MAHLI and APXS targets into the plan on the \"Cheshire\" and \"Duitschland\" targets to further augment the chemistry derived from the remote ChemCam observations.

Back in late March, nearly 180 Mars-days ago and when Curiosity was investigating the last stretches of the Bagnold Dunes before continuing towards Vera Rubin Ridge, Curiosity's scoop gathered a sample called \"Ogunquit Beach.\" In order to quantitatively determine the mineral assemblage present in this sample of a sand dune, Curiosity would have to deliver the sample to the CheMin X-ray diffractometer instrument. However, because of the ongoing troubles with the arm's drill feed, Curiosity has been stuck with Ogunquit Beach in \"storage\" and unable to deliver the sample to CheMin - until this weekend! Tomorrow, at around 7:30am PDT, Curiosity will be given the \"all clear\" to deliver Ogunquit Beach to CheMin. Throughout the weekend, CheMin will analyze this sample, precisely measuring diffraction data for deriving its mineral assemblage, and will send the data back to Earth. The science team is very excited to be crossing this milestone, and we can't wait to compare Ogunquit Beach to the other measurements of the Bagnold Dunes acquired over the last few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to this big achievement, Curiosity will also be investigating interesting science targets directly in front of her. The first task of the \"weekend\" on Mars will be to investigate three geologic targets of interest. First, the ChemCam laser system will be used to determine the chemistry of the targets \"Katberg,\" \"Normandien,\" and \"Black Reef.\" Katberg is a relatively flat and benign piece of bedrock lying directly in front of the rover. Normandien is a bit further away from the rover, and is a darker rock sitting on top of the local bedrock, sand, and dust. Lastly, Black Reef is another darker rock (though slightly larger and more rounded than Normandien) that doesn't appear to be a piece of the local bedrock in the immediate rover surroundings. Following these measurements, Mastcam will document these three targets, as well as acquiring a few small mosaics of the local bedrock to the left and right of the rover and monitoring environmental conditions (e.g., atmospheric dust). The afternoon of this day is dedicated to delivering Ogunquit Beach to CheMin, with CheMin analyzing the sample overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early Mars morning of the second day, Curiosity will make some additional atmospheric observations using Mastcam and Navcam. Later that afternoon, Curiosity's arm will swing into position, will brush away any dust or debris from the Katberg target, and will image Katberg with the high-resolution MAHLI camera. The APXS instrument will then be used to collect an overnight chemical analysis of Katberg. Midday on the third day, Curiosity will stow her arm and set off towards the east to continue making progress through Vera Rubin Ridge. After her drive, Curiosity will acquire some necessary post-drive images before returning them to Earth for the science team to analyze on Monday morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile most of this weekend's activities are fairly \"normal\" in the context of our recent scientific investigations, delivering Ogunquit Beach to CheMin marks an important milestone for utilizing this valuable rover asset.

Contact science was planned on a dark-toned target named \"Collingham\" in the hopes that the darker color indicated either a different chemistry or reduced surface dust. APXS, MAHLI, ChemCam, and Mastcam will all cooperate on observing this target. Mastcam will continue the Vera Rubin Ridge imaging campaign by capturing a 13x1 mosaic of a prominent outcrop, named \"Tra Tra,\" which is the large outcrop at the top left of the above Navcam image. (Mt. Sharp is to the right.) A stereo image will be taken to ascertain the geometry of the bedding. Curiosity then will drive about 11 meters towards the top of a nearby ridge. Post-drive Navcam imaging will be taken as well as an automated AEGIS imaging activity with ChemCam.<br/>\n<br/>\nENV accommodated the power-saving requirements of the plan by not performing any imaging and only including REMS and DAN activities. The normal cadence of REMS observations was also scaled back in such a way as to not degrade the ability to perform good science. ENV can ensure this flexibility by shuffling the placement of REMS extended blocks (EBs) from one sol to the next or dropping very low-priority EBs. (Note that EBs should not be confused with the top-of-the-hour 5-minute blocks that are always scheduled.) Though the EB observations themselves are not power intensive, the additional wake-up time to retrieve these data from REMS memory into rover memory so that they may be relayed to Earth (an activity appropriately called a REMS Get Data) can use considerable power if required at night, especially during the winter season. The number of these Get Datas in any given plan can be reduced by simply cutting back on the number of EBs. (For a typical cadence in a 1-sol plan, about three or four Get Datas are required.) ENV can reduce the impact of dropped EBs on science goals by deferring the dropped blocks to future plans. This adaptability can be achieved because the highest-priority EB cadence is designed to capture a full sol of environmental measurements every six sols-that is, there are four evenly spaced 1-hr blocks every sol that get pushed backward by one hour in the following sol. (I.e., Sol 1830 has blocks at 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100, while Sol 1831 will have blocks at 0200, 0800, 1400, and 2000. And so on.) Capturing a full sol of environmental monitoring at a regular frequency is important to ensure that any localized atmospheric phenomena are not missed as Curiosity explores Gale Crater. Additional high-priority observations support other MSL experiments (e.g., during expected SAM drop-off or atmospheric intake times or Mastcam change detection experiments) and concurrent monitoring when THEMIS (Thermal Emission Imaging System) onboard Mars Odyssey or MCS (Mars Climate Sounder) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is observing Curiosity's location. These are impossible to postpone but occur at specific, pre-planned times. At medium priority are periodic <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1686-march-to-the-megaripples\">HRIM (High Resolution Interval Mode for humidity)</a>-or morning-EBs and a noon EB every sol that looks for pressure drops from small-scale vortices (like dust devils). At low-priority are migrating two-hour EBs to detect any meteorological changes that might last longer than the usual hour-long blocks. All of these EB observations are usually easy to fit in the plan because they do not require the rover to be awake; however, the accompanying Get Datas must occur when the rover is awake. If the timing of awake periods due to other activities, like a communications pass, does not line up with the required Get Datas, then low-priority blocks can be dropped altogether and/or high-priority blocks can be pushed to the following sols to reduce the number of requisite Get Datas in a plan. For example, in the Sol 1831 plan, the 0300 and the 0200 blocks will be captured. In this way, the number of Get Datas and the ENV power requirements in a given plan are reduced, and a full sol of observations can still be taken within the six-sol goal.</p>"}, "1829": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1829-hello-kuruman", "text": "<p>As was predicted in yesterday's blog <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1828-bye-bye-bar-harbor\">mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1828-bye-bye-bar-harbor</a>, we have officially left the \"Bar Harbor\" quadrangle and are now into the \"Kuruman\" quadrangle.

The upcoming plan involves a quick \"touch-and-go\" using the APXS and MAHLI instruments for the chemical and morphological investigation (respectively) of a flat piece of bedrock named \"Sherwood Forest.\" After stowing her arm, Curiosity will then use Mastcam and ChemCam to analyze both \"Sherwood Forest\" and a dark-toned target named \"Tableland.\" These targets are located just to the left of center in this <a href=\"https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FRB_559245347EDR_F0660384FHAZ00302M_&amp;s=1822\">front Hazcam image</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore driving away, Curiosity will also create a high-resolution Mastcam mosaic of a region to the southwest of her current location. This region was identified from orbit as a potential region of interest, as it shows a relatively steep slope with some potentially interesting bedrock exposures. Ever since ascending onto Vera Rubin Ridge, Curiosity has been making progress towards this location to determine whether it is worth investigating from close-range. As it turns out, the region doesn't appear all that different from the parts of the ridge that Curiosity has already been exploring. So, instead of continuing the southwest drive towards this location, the team decided to blanket the area in high-resolution color imagery before turning to the east-southeast and towards another region of interest. Updating the rover's planned traverse path using both orbital and ground-based data is very common, and this decision by the science team highlights how collaborative discussions and the ability to adjust plans in real-time can both save time and maximize the scientific return of the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe title of today's blog post is a quote from the beginning of the 1883 novel \"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\" by Howard Pyle.

There were hints around the workspace that color variations were present, with surfaces visible in shades of tan, gray and purple, so the science team decided to push the drive off a day and stay to use the Dust Removal Tool (DRT) once again on the VRR rocks in the workspace. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe science team was not only in a cleaning mood, they were in a tongue twisting mood, as evidenced by the names of the two MAHLI and APXS targets, \"Passadumkeag\" (a small Maine town) and \"Pennessewassee\" (a lake near Norway, Maine). Passadumkeag, a tan-colored target, will benefit from the DRT's revelatory powers, while Pennessewassee, a more gray-colored target, will be interrogated as is. ChemCam will shoot Passadumkeag, adding to the chemical data from that target, as well as \"Uncle Zeke Island\" and \"Mustards Island.\" The Uncle Zeke Island raster will cover an area of bedrock where its color changes from bluish to purplish.

So the APXS will measure the chemistry of Christmas Cove before it is brushed off, then will be placed on the brushed spot to measure chemical differences. MAHLI will image both targets before and after brushing, then acquire a full suite of images on a layered block dubbed \"Whittum.\" Also on Sol 1818, ChemCam will shoot its laser at another layered bedrock block named \"Medomak.\" Mastcam will also image Medomak, the Sun, and the crater rim to measure dust opacity in the atmosphere.

The rover is now parked on many of the bedding structures observed from farther down the ridge, and the science team selected several particularly nice examples - the targets \"Jordans Delight,\" Mount Waldo,\" and \"Three Bush Island\" - for detailed Mastcam imaging. Other features of interest were the gray, rounded nodules observed all around the rover.

The goal is to be able to measure the ChemCam laser pits in the DEM. Of course, the ChemCam shots will also provide chemistry of Robinson Rock complementary to the APXS analysis of the target.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth before and after a ~27 m drive that will place Curiosity right below the smooth bedrock cap on the lower part of the Vera Rubin Ridge, she will tear her eyes off the rocks and scan the skies above Gale.

Curiosity will start off on Sol 1797 with a long (2h 45m) science block full of a variety of remote sensing. Mastcam has a multispectral observation of some gray pebbles named \"Bois Bubert\" followed by a routine image of the rover deck to monitor dust accumulation. Then Mastcam takes a break while ChemCam analyzes the pebbles at \"Bois Bubert,\" some bedrock at \"Doliver,\" some \"redder\"-looking bedrock at \"Shag Rock,\" and another more typical bedrock target called \"Abagadasset\". ChemCam also has two long-distance RMI mosaics of \"Vera Rubin Ridge\" to help see the detailed sedimentary structure of the ridge. After ChemCam is done, Mastcam resumes its work, taking context images of all the ChemCam targets, and a large 44-frame mosaic of Vera Rubin Ridge. That is followed by routine atmospheric dust observations with Mastcam. But wait, there's more! That was just the first science block! Once the remote sensing is done, MAHLI and APXS will analyze the targets \"Abagadasset\" and \"Doliver.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sol 1798, the morning science block is dedicated to atmospheric observations.

Today's plan is a perfect example of these split scientific priorities. The team selected several targets near the rover to analyze using its remote sensing instruments, while also allowing time for the rover to drive approximately 15 meters ahead and get into position for tomorrow's science and this weekend's long imaging campaign of VRR.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Curiosity awakes at about 10am local time on Mars (approximately 9pm PDT on Thursday evening), her scientific activities will begin with two active ChemCam chemistry investigations of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRB_556226499EDR_F0650916NCAM00375M_&amp;s=1788\">two bedrock targets</a> immediately in front of the rover. The first target (named \"Megee,\" located just above the shadow of Curiosity's mast in the lower portion of the image) contains an interesting linear feature that is likely a vein of altered material that is common to the Murray formation. The second target (named \"Manana,\" located above and to the left of \"Megee\") is a more \"classic\" and representative Murray bedrock target, which will help scientists to determine how the Murray formation changes as Curiosity moves laterally and vertically within this mudstone-dominated unit. After these measurements, Curiosity will then use the high resolution Mastcam to document these two targets, will perform routine imaging of the rover deck, and will take stereo images (to produce three-dimensional information) of a complex ripple field just off the right-front wheel of the rover (named \"Leadbetter\"). Sediment ripples on Mars have fascinated scientists for decades, and continue to be extensively studied using both orbital and landed spacecraft. With Mars' lower gravity and lack of vegetation, scientists can learn quite a bit about how local wind patterns interact with sediment of differing grain sizes to form ripples with different shapes and wavelengths. The science team was lucky to have such an interesting ripple target close to today's study area to further this long-duration study of Martian sedimentary processes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the planned ~15 meter drive to take place in the early Martian afternoon, Curiosity will perform some quick imaging of her surroundings and VRR using the Navcam cameras before sending these data up to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and then back to Earth for tomorrow's science planning activities. Following this data transfer, Curiosity will complete her Navcam imaging (including a survey for nearby dust devils) and will use Mastcam to look for nearby rocks. ChemCam will also perform an automated chemistry analysis of a target of interest in the surrounding landscape using its AEGIS capabilities. Lastly, the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) will continue its faithful tradition of imaging the terrain just below the rover's belly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow's plan will also include activities for Curiosity to complete over the weekend, which will include a large Mastcam mosaic of VRR from this new perspective. Within the next few weeks, Curiosity will make another turn to the south to begin her ascent up VRR. Once on top of the ridge, it will be very difficult to image and analyze any evidence of layering or spectral variations that may be observed looking at the layers leading up to the top of the ridge. To a geologist, this layering (or stratigraphy, in geologic terms) is oftentimes the most important data that one can acquire in trying to understand the origin and history of geologic features. Think about all of the information you might be able to learn from the layering exposed in the Grand Canyon - the top of the Grand Canyon is far less interesting than the layers exposed within it. Therefore, we are trying to be as diligent as possible to methodically image the ridge on our approach.</p>"}, "1788": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1788-continuing-up-the-vera-rubin-ridge", "text": "<p>I was the Surface Properties Scientist, or SPS, on staff today. After completing a successful drive back to the strategic route to continue up the Vera Rubin Ridge, we arrived at a workspace filled with sand and a lone rock outcrop dubbed \"<a href=\"https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_556139964EDR_F0650646NCAM00375M_&amp;s=1787\">Dumplings Island</a>\" seen in the center of the included image. This rock outcrop was the focus of most of today's planned activities, including high resolution microscopic imaging with the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) to characterize the outcrop's particle size and small scale textures. In addition Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) and ChemCam observations were planned to understand the composition of this rock outcrop, providing another important compositional data point as Curiosity traverses the Vera Rubin Ridge stratigraphy. The rover to passed its Slip Risk Assessment Process (SRAP) with flying colors, which was needed to carry out the arm-based activities in today's plan. After finishing the drive to the current location, Curiosity ended up on a relatively flat spot with its wheels in good contact with the sandy surface that likely overlies bedrock. As such, the likelihood of rover wheel slippage due to arm activities was judged to be very low.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the strong desire to continue to drive up the Vera Rubin Ridge, there was a tradeoff between extending the duration of science activities and extending the planned drive. As the plan was already quite busy, no additional science duration was able to be allocated and the rover only got a few more minutes of drive time. In all, there wasn't much wiggle room in today's plan! Not much additional imaging, other than that required to characterize the compositional targets, made it in to the plan either. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe path for the coming sols should follow our predefined strategic route closely as there's a lower slope gap in the steep cliffs of the Vera Rubin Ridge that makes for a safe path to the top. It should be an exciting next few days of planning with some great views once Curiosity makes it to the top of the ridge and can look out over the path that's been driven in the past 5 years of Mars

The rover will begin her morning activities at approximately 9:30pm PDT, and about an hour later will conduct the short APXS measurement and high-resolution MAHLI imaging on a smooth block of the Murray formation known as \"Foxbird.\" Later, the ChemCam instrument will collect chemistry information of Foxbird by ablating five small spots in the target using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and recording the spectral properties of the generated plasma to determine the chemistry of the target. An additional Murray bedrock target known as \"Damariscotta\" will be targeted in three locations using ChemCam.

Damariscotta is home to Whaleback Shell Midden, a huge heap of oyster shells that were discarded by the native populations well before the arrival of Europeans to the region. Digging through this midden reveals layer after layer of loosely consolidated shells that are now incorporated into the local geologic record.

Today I served as the Science Operations Working Group Chair. A high level of charge in Curiosity's batteries after the long holiday weekend allowed us to prepare a bounty of science observations. The first activity was contact science, a mix of APXS and MAHLI, on a target named \"Appledore\" which is believed to be Murray bedrock much like we've examined before. This was followed by a Navcam survey for dust devils on the slopes of Mt. Sharp and then ChemCam targets on \"Sugar_Plum\" and \"Whortleberry\", the later of which appears to be a dark-toned pebble mixed into the light-toned Murray bedrock.

After completing a successful drive, Curiosity arrived at a nice workspace to carry out the weekend plan. Today's planning activities were for a three sol plan, where the weekend activities were scheduled, including several arm activities and a drive for the last sol of the plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two arm activities included the targets \"Mingo\" and \"Jobbies\", each of which were located on Murray bedrock exposures. The Mingo target was chosen for a DRT because of its relatively smooth nature, making it suitable to brush the ever-present Martian dust away. The Jobbies target seemed to have a darker, gray toned appearance that intrigued the science team on shift today. Supporting remote sensing science was planned of the scene and will be used to both give context to the contact science and help continue finding a path up the Vera Rubin Ridge.<br/>\nAs SPS, today I worked with rover planners to help identify a clear path up the Vera Rubin Ridge, avoiding large, steeply dipping rocks to the left of the rover and dodging a big sand trap to the right of the rover. These features can be seen in the Navcam image shown, where the rover will drive just to right of the layered rock on the upper left side of the image. It turns out the best path forward was to put the rover wheels on either side and drive right over the top of a rock that was about 33 cm in height!

As Curiosity progresses towards the east, scientists back on Earth continue to look for opportunities to both gaze ahead towards interesting locations on the ridge itself, in addition to looking at the local rocks and sediment surrounding the rover. As we approach the lower units of Vera Rubin Ridge, our measurements of the \"typical\" rock that surrounds the rover will be vital to helping scientists understand how and why the ridge is different than the other units that have been investigated thus far in Gale Crater. Are we going to observe a very sharp transition in the composition and textures of rocks as we cross the threshold between the underlying mudstones of the Murray formation and the lowermost units of Vera Rubin Ridge? Or, alternatively, are we going to see a very subtle transition that might have gone unnoticed if not for the methodical measurements made upon approaching the ridge? Only time will tell, but we are making sure that we have the information necessary to definitively understand the nature of this transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur science plan for the next two days begins with firing the ChemCam laser at a bedrock target right in front of Curiosity known as \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRB_551884866EDR_F0641470NCAM00297M_&amp;s=1739\">Cat Sized Island</a>\". The rock is almost a meter in length (more of a bobcat size than a standard house cat) and shows some interesting nodular textures that the science team wants to investigate further. Following this measurement, two different regions of Vera Rubin Ridge itself will be imaged using the ChemCam high-resolution Remote Micro-Imager (RMI). These measurements and observations will be followed up with color images collected by Mastcam for general documentation of the ridge, \"Cat Sized Island,\" and the ChemCam target that was automatically analyzed after yesterday's drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing these measurements, Curiosity will again take to the road and head further east northeast, positioning herself towards the northernmost tip of the nearby sand ripple patch. In the next few days, the plan is to turn Curiosity towards the east southeast around these ripples and towards the ideal location to begin the climb up Vera Rubin Ridge, which is still another ~275 meters distant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rover team is still operating under restricted planning conditions this week, which occurs when the offset in time between Earth and Mars prohibits the team from acquiring, downlinking, and analyzing the data collected by the rover with sufficient time to generate and uplink a science plan to the rover on a daily basis. In addition, with the Fourth of July holiday early next week, today's plan includes activities for three days on the Martian surface. Following Curiosity's drive, she will acquire her standard Navcam imagery surrounding the rover to allow Friday's science planning team to have a good view of the area accessible to the rover and the instruments. ChemCam will also acquire a LIBS analysis of an automatically selected target, and will also acquire passive spectra of several calibration targets onboard the deck of the rover. Lastly, MAHLI will image a tray on the rover deck that has been collecting windblown sand to help scientists better understand the properties of these particles and how the local winds are able to move materials. Curiosity will then turn in for the evening, but will wake up around 4:30am local time to image Deimos using the Mastcam instrument. The next morning, Curiosity will resume her science activities with a series of ChemCam passive observations of calibration targets on the deck of the rover, as well as Mastcam imaging of the rover deck to check on the hardware and monitor debris cover.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the afternoon of the second day, Curiosity will acquire additional images that have become a familiar and consistent component of the rover's scientific investigation. The fixed and immovable Mars Descent Imager, or MARDI, will acquire a suite of images looking just below the rover's belly. MARDI acquired high-resolution video at four frames per second during <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/multimedia/videos/?v=77\">Curiosity's descent to the Martian surface</a>, and while its primary objective was completed the moment Curiosity landed safely on Mars, MARDI has since been used to perform surface science. MARDI routinely collects images of the ground immediately beneath the rover to characterize the physical properties of both rocks and sediment as the rover travels through Gale Crater. Because of its consistent viewing geometry and spatial resolution of approximately one millimeter per pixel, MARDI image acquisition has become a routine and integral component to our scientific investigation of the landscapes immediately surrounding Curiosity rover as she continues her journey up Mt. Sharp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third and final day of this observation plan will be dominated by environmental monitoring using both the Navcam and Mastcam instruments. First, Navcam will acquire several images to hunt for dust devils in Gale Crater. Then, Mastcam will acquire images of the rim of Gale Crater to investigate the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere. Lastly, Navcam will point nearly straight up and acquire several images over several minutes to observe any possible clouds in the sky and their movement due to atmospheric winds. These observations will be used by scientists to improve our understanding of atmospheric processes on Mars and the specific atmospheric conditions present in Gale Crater.</p>"}, "1739": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1739-1740-more-touch-and-go-on-the-way-to-vera-rubin-ridge", "text": "<p>This past weekend, Curiosity continued to journey east along the contact between the lower portion of Vera Rubin Ridge and the Murray formation with a drive that was a little over 20 m long.

The remainder of the science for this plan is focused on gazing longingly towards Vera Rubin Ridge. From this vantage point, we will be acquiring imagery of the northern exposure of the ridge (named \"Northern Neck\") using several techniques. First, we will use the multispectral capabilities of Mastcam (see below for more details) to investigate any possible compositional variations observed within this lower ridge material. Next, we will take a series of overlapping high-resolution images using ChemCam's remote microimager. Although these images won't cover the entirety of the exposure, they will allow scientists to interrogate the fine-scale sedimentary structures present within the ridge. Lastly, we will again turn to Mastcam to image the entirety of \"Northern Neck\" in true-color, similar to how your eyes would perceive the ridge if you were standing on the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this science imaging, Curiosity will again take off driving towards the east-northeast. The following day, Curiosity will image the rover deck using Mastcam, hunt for dust devils using the navigation cameras, and acquire additional chemistry data of local targets using <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/2017/laser-targeting-ai-yields-more-mars-science\">ChemCam's automated target selection software known as AEGIS</a>. The science and engineering teams will again reconvene on Friday to formulate the weekend's science plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to provide a little more context regarding the multispectral imaging capabilities of Mastcam. The cones in a human eye are sensitive to blue, green, and red wavelengths of light which, combined, allow us to see the full range of visible colors. Using a series of filters, Mastcam is able to finely control the wavelengths of light that enter the camera. This means that we can accurately calibrate the data to quantify how surfaces reflect specific wavelengths of light. In addition, Mastcam can record wavelengths beyond the sensitivity of the human eye in the near-infrared, and this additional information can be used to further investigate the composition of the martian surface. Just like how table salt is white and garnets are red, other geologic materials exhibit unique signatures in the infrared as well. As a result, Mastcam is an extremely useful geologic tool onboard Curiosity, as it allows us to investigate differences in the composition of distant surfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the key compositional properties of Vera Rubin Ridge is the presence of the iron oxide phase hematite, as determined from orbital observations. Iron oxides are the primary constituents of rust on Earth, which can exhibit spectacular variations in color, and so identifying and characterizing minor color variations throughout the ridge will be important as the mission continues towards the ridge. What is the lateral and vertical distribution of these unique iron oxide phases? Do they vary significantly over the rover's traverse? These questions (and many more) will continue to be the focus of the MSL science team for months to come!</p>"}, "1732": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-1732-1733-marching-ahead-towards-vera-rubin-ridge", "text": "<p>As this is my first time contributing to the MSL blog, I'd like to quickly introduce myself to you all. I'm Mark, an MSL Participating Scientist and a faculty member at Northern Arizona University, trained in geochemistry, spectroscopy, and remote sensing. I'm excited to help walk you all through the daily endeavors of this wonderful rover and mission!<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity continues to make progress along its planned ascent route up Mt. Sharp, and is quickly approaching the hematite-bearing Vera Rubin Ridge. As a refresher, Vera Rubin Ridge is a high-standing unit that runs parallel to and along the eastern side of the Bagnold Dunes. From orbit, Vera Rubin Ridge has been shown to exhibit signatures of hematite, an oxidized iron phase whose presence can help us to better understand the environmental conditions present when this mineral assemblage formed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the weekend, Curiosity drove approximately 32 meters and parked in front of a <a href=\"https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01730/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_551082821EDR_F0640678NCAM00375M_.JPG\">large rocky slab</a> (about the size of a large dining room table) with smaller rocky patches nearby, perfect for our continued documentation of the local bedrock. This slab will be extensively imaged using Mastcam. In addition to imaging, three rocky targets will be chemically analyzed by the rover. \"Pierce Head\" represents an unremarkable piece of the Murray formation, and will be investigated using ChemCam and APXS (and MAHLI context imaging) to fully characterize the bedrock chemistry at this location. Alternatively, \"Mosely Point\" and \"Leland Point\" appear darker in tone and exhibit slightly rougher and smoother textures, respectively, and will be investigated using only ChemCam.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing these analyses, Curiosity will set off on another drive over rough terrain to the east, where the rover will document its surroundings using its automated ChemCam targeting capabilities and its suite of cameras. In particular, the rover will turn its cameras to Vera Rubin Ridge for another suite of high resolution color images, which will help to characterize any observed layers, fractures, or geologic contacts. These observations will help the science team to determine how Vera Rubin Ridge formed and its relationship to the other geologic units found within Gale Crater.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother super interesting observation that will be made during this planning period is an opportunistic nighttime astronomical observation of Mars' smallest moon Deimos, which will be imaged using Mastcam. Even though Deimos is only ~8 miles in diameter, Mastcam's incredible resolution and pointing capabilities make these observations seem routine. Imaging Mars' moons allows scientists to better understand the evolution of their orbits over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are currently in a phase of \"restricted planning,\" where the offset in time between the Earth and Mars prohibits our ability to downlink data with sufficient time to plan on a daily basis. So, the science and engineering teams planned two days' worth of rover activities today. We will reconvene on Wednesday to produce a similar two-day plan, and will do so through next week. Despite this offset, the crafty and efficient science and engineering teams are able to successfully create rover plans that ensure Curiosity is busy as it continues its journey up Mt.

On the first sol, we will do some contact science on the rather colorful workspace that is currently in front of the rover. We will be collecting MAHLI and APXS observations of two targets, \"Frazer Creek\" and \"Lurvey Spring.\" We will also collect some ChemCam observations of \"Mark Island\" and Frazer Creek plus the corresponding Mastcam documentation images of these targets. Finally, we will take a full multispectral filter Mastcam observation of Mark Island, as well as additional Mastcam images of targets \"Big Spencer Mountain\" and \"Monument Cove.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity will wake up around 3 in the morning between the first and second sols of the plan to make a special observation of Mars' moon Phobos. We are going to watch Phobos as it emerges from Mars' shadow into sunlight. This will help us measure the amount and size of dust particles in Mars' upper atmosphere. After the sun rises on the second sol of the weekend plan, we'll do full MAHLI wheel imaging (or FMWI in rover-acronym speak). We take images of our wheels using MAHLI throughout a full wheel rotation every few hundred meters to track the rate of wheel damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the third sol of the plan, we will drive and have a post-drive ChemCam AEGIS observation and dust devil search. The drive will place us ~35 meters closer to the second Vera Rubin Ridge approach-imaging stop. The data Curiosity collected during the first imaging stop earlier in the week have been coming down over the last few days, and they look absolutely spectacular. For example, a portion of the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=CR0_550807154PRC_F0640000CCAM01727L1&amp;s=1727\">ChemCam RMI mosaic</a> we took of the lower most layers of the ridge show a lot of fine-scale layers. I mapped Vera Rubin Ridge using orbital data as part of my PhD thesis five years ago, so it's been so exciting for me to see these images after staring at the area from above for so long.

Last weekend, however, time and power were dedicated to a more rare, and more complex, activity - analysis of a previously-drilled rock sample by SAM. To keep up our regular cadence of contact science, the team effectively extended the weekend by a day, planning contact science in this Monday plan.

The mast instruments also got in on the action, with ChemCam shooting both Haynes Point and Barr Hill, and Mastcam acquiring a multispectral observation that covered all three contact science targets.

The SPS has an interesting job, in that the SPS helps Rover Planners (called RPs) assess the terrain around the rover with safety in mind, first and foremost. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two main jobs of an SPS. The first is to assess how likely the rover is to slip in its current position, called the Slip Risk Assessment Process (SRAP). Is it on a stable footing, like thin sand cover over smooth rocks, or is a wheel perched on a ledge? The reason this is important is because as MSL's arm is articulated to conduct contact science, a perched rover wheel might slip and cause damage to the arm by contact between the turret and the ground. That would be bad! Today we were on a solid surface and passed SRAP without any concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other job of the SPS is to help the RPs find a safe path forward if there is a drive planned. On some sols this is a very taxing job, other days not so much. Today was in the middle. The RPs use high resolution digital terrain models generated from imagery taken from the previous sol after the latest drive to plan a safe path to the next stopping point, while avoiding rocks, ledges, and deep sand. The RPs confer with the SPS to evaluate the proposed route making any modifications necessary along the way.

It also meant that we had plenty of time to choose our favorite target names from the list!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the data started rolling in, we quickly chose a nice piece of bedrock in front of the rover for APXS and MAHLI to analyze and gave it the target name \"Aunt Betsey's Brook\". We also planned a ChemCam observation of a flaky layered rock called \"Wonsqueak Harbor\" and a small Mastcam mosaic of a block of layered bedrock called \"Little Round Pond\". After that, Curiosity will drive about 16 meters and collect post-drive imaging for targeting.

It was a plan full of trade-offs. When SAM takes atmospheric methane or oxygen measurements, ENV likes to obtain a ChemCam passive sky observation within a few sols for an independent comparison. However, the times initially available in the plan around mid-sol to place a passive sky were not compatible with possible pointing azimuths, as we are so <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-1668-1670-diving-into-analysis-of-moosehead-lake\">close to the new year</a> (northern hemisphere spring equinox). In anticipation of potential power restrictions in the weekend plan, we attempted a long morning imaging suite a couple of sols early, which would include a passive sky measurement; however, we were forced to defer those plans due to power restrictions in the current plan. Instead of losing the science time altogether, we noticed that the mid-sol time was compatible for taking a ChemCam calibration measurement. This calibration will be taken on Sol 1708 in preparation for the next passive sky. This just proves that while doing science on another planet can be frustrating at times, it is always rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of the ChemCam calibration, the ENV group planned several Mastcam and Navcam observations.

We brushed dust off the target \"Fern Spring\" with the DRT and analyzed two separate spots within this dust-cleared area with APXS. Getting two closely spaced APXS targets makes it easier to pull apart compositional variations within the outcrop than a single APXS analysis alone. We planned a ChemCam raster over Fern Spring to be able to compare the compositional results from APXS and ChemCam, and a second, similar target, \"Redfield Hill\" to maximize the amount of data from the bedrock. Another target that got attention from both APXS and ChemCam was \"Pulpit Ledge\", so named because this gray-toned area of outcrop appeared perched above the rest of the outcrop surface. The gray color of Pulpit Ledge set it apart from the more orange-red color of Fern Spring and Redfield Hill, and the science team hoped to gain insight into why these parts of the outcrop were different in color by looking at these distinct targets. We looked at another gray outcrop area, \"Broad Cove\", using the passive mode of ChemCam and the multispectral capability of Mastcam. Both these techniques assess the spectrum of light reflected from the target surface, which provides insight into the iron mineralogy of the target. Each APXS target was imaged with MAHLI, to not only help inform APXS of exactly what part of the outcrop they obtained data from, but to look closely at the texture and grain size of the targets. Looking out past the outcrop immediately in front of us, Mastcam acquired small mosaics of two separate areas of dramatically layered Murray formation. Such large, layered blocks make driving through this part of the Murray formation a challenge, but they help the science team understand how the Murray formation rocks were deposited in Gale crater.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity cast her gaze skyward over the weekend acquiring images and movies seeking clouds and dust devils, and monitoring the amount of dust in the atmosphere. Measurements of dust in the atmosphere not only provide insight into atmospheric behavior, they help the science team decide when to image distant objects such as Vera Rubin Ridge.

As we climb up Mount Sharp, recently over slopes of 4-6 degrees, we have seen more varied outcrop structures and chemistries than the rest of the Murray formation, and such changes catch the collective eye of the team. Today's plan will keep Curiosity busy throughout the weekend, investigating some of these unique rocks. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne target in the workspace in particular, \"Mason Point\", will get the royal treatment with five separate science observations directed at it. The reason it will receive such attention is that it will be brushed by the Dust Removal Tool (DRT), removing the thin veneer of obscuring dust that has settled on the rock surface. From the brushed Mason Point target, we will obtain MAHLI images to study the target's texture and grain size, ChemCam and Mastcam spectra of the light reflected off the surface to constrain mineralogy, and an APXS analysis to get chemistry. We will also analyze the chemistry of Mason Point with a ChemCam raster, but before it is brushed. Why? ChemCam's laser not only probes chemistry, it clears dust! The comprehensive and complementary datasets obtained from Mason Point will further our understanding of this target better than any single analysis would alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMason Point will get the most focused attention, but the analysis of many other targets will help the science team probe the overall variety of the rocks in this area. MAHLI, APXS and ChemCam will study \"Mitchell Hill\", a bedrock target exhibiting prominent layering. ChemCam will also shoot \"Mount Gilboa\" to gather not only chemistry but grain size data for this target. Mastcam mosaics centered on Mitchell Hill and \"Manchester Point\" will capture orientations of layers in these targets that might help reveal how the layers formed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a change of pace from looking at rocks, Curiosity invested time in the plan acquiring images with MAHLI that monitor the health and performance of the instrument. MAHLI imaged her calibration target, which contains well known color and geometric targets that offer a test of instrument performance. MAHLI also imaged the APXS calibration target, a slab of finely polished basalt that serves as a chemistry standard for APXS. MAHLI then turned her eye to the sky, purposely acquiring images of featureless parts of the sky. These images, called sky flats, help reveal the presence of dust on the MAHLI lens. Just like dentist appointments, calibration \"checkups\" occur about every six months. Happily, MAHLI checkups are pain free.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the rover planners drive Curiosity over 50 meters along our strategic drive path, Mastcam and Navcam will obtain a number of images and movies used to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere, scan the atmosphere for dust devils, and search the sky overhead and near the horizon for clouds.

We certainly put Curiosity to work, planning MAHLI and APXS observations of the target \"Schoolhouse Ledge\" along the ripple crest, and the target \"Man of War Brook\" along the flank of the ripple. To keep the structure of the ripple crest pristine for MAHLI imaging, we shot ChemCam across another part of the ripple crest, the target \"Gilpatrick Ledge\". We also used ChemCam to interrogate the target \"The Gorge\", located inside the wheel scuff the rover planners purposely cut into the ripple to expose its interior structure. GEO planned a Mastcam observation using filters at specific wavelengths of light that help constrain what iron-bearing minerals are present within the sands. The target for this observation was \"Cobbosseecontee Lake\", which one of our Maine-dwelling team members insisted was not challenging to say (it is actually pretty phonetic\u2026)! Even with our focus on the megaripple, there was still time to image the rocks around us with Mastcam, including an expanse of well-layered bedrock south of us called \"Amphitheater Valley\". Last but not least, GEO started a series of MARDI images - one image acquired each evening we are parked at the megaripple - to look for wind-induced changes. These change detection images help the team understand if (or how) wind activity and direction are changing as we leave the Bagnold dunes.

I always really enjoy days like this because, even after 1,676 sols and just under 16.1 kilometers of driving, it still thrills me to look at images from unexplored areas of Mars. Immediately after inspecting the data, the science team jumped into planning by debating whether we wanted to spend the morning of Sol 1677 doing remote sensing, or if we wanted to spend the time doing contact science with the arm, all before an early afternoon drive continuing up Mt. Sharp.<br/>\n<br/>\nA big part of the science team strategy for exploring the Murray formation, the group of rocks that are the lowest and oldest in Mt. Sharp, has been to systematically characterize their changing chemistry and mineralogy. Understanding how these properties vary with elevation gives us insight into changing conditions in the geologic processes that deposited and altered these rocks during burial. Because two of Curiosity's wheels were perched on rocks during Friday's planning, we were unable to safely use the arm to measure their chemistry using the APXS (Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer). Since we had the opportunity to make these measurements again today and since the rover wheels were in good contact with the underlying terrain, we easily agreed we would shorten our remote sensing block and instead use the morning time to take advantage of the opportunity for contact science.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe area directly in front of the rover was filled mostly with sand, but we were pleased to find there was a small patch of Murray bedrock that we were able to reach with the arm and that wasn't filled with white veins. While veins and filled fractures are extremely interesting and frequently targeted for study, their presence in the field of view of the APXS makes it more difficult to understand the changing chemistry of the primary Murray bedrock. We named our contact science target \"Casco Bay\" and planned both MAHLI and APXS observations of it. We also managed to have enough time in the plan for a little bit of remote sensing, and used that to take ChemCam observations of Casco Bay that will complement the contact science measurements. We also planned to take several Mastcam color images to help us document the geologic context of our surroundings. Environmental science also requested a dust devil movie plan. After our morning science block, we planned another drive to continue our way up Mt.

The rover has to be sitting stably on the terrain for us to conduct contact science, with none of the six wheels in danger of slipping off a rock as we deploy the arm and turret. The arm and turret together are over 2 m in length and 95 kg in mass, providing a lever arm significant enough to move even our 900 kg rover! When placing APXS in contact with a rock, or MAHLI 1 cm away from a rock, the last thing you want is for the rover to move. While the rock in our workspace was indeed enticing, the rover planners found that two of our wheels were partially perched on rock slabs like those in the workspace, precluding us from using APXS and getting MAHLI any closer than 10 cm to any target in the workspace.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith these constraints in place, the science team set out to make lemonade. GEO planned three ChemCam rasters, with the \"Back Cove\" and \"Lookout Point\" targets selected to survey the chemistry and grain size of the Murray bedrock, and the \"South Brother\" target aimed at one of the gray, non-Murray pebbles seen dotting the bedrock surface in the workspace. We imaged both \"Back Cove\" and \"Lookout Point\" with MAHLI from 10 cm, the former with a single image, and the latter with a 3x2 mosaic that also captured multiple Murray layers around \"Lookout Point\". Mastcam also imaged the three ChemCam targets, and acquired mosaics of the Murray bedrock structures both in front of and along the starboard side of the rover. Since we would be in place for multiple sols, GEO planned two Mastcam images of the sandy target \"Grant Cove\", one image on Sol 1674 and the second on Sol 1675, to look for wind-induced changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nENV kept busy, obtaining their weekly morning imaging suite paired with afternoon observations to determine diurnal variability in cloud cover and the amount of dust in the atmosphere using both Mastcam and Navcam. ENV took advantage of the ability to use MAHLI, as well, acquiring an image of the REMS UV sensor. This is done periodically to determine the amount of dust covering the UV photodiodes, because the longer Curiosity remains in the Martian environment, the more dust settles on the detectors. The increased dust covering the photodiodes affects the REMS UV dust measurements of the atmosphere, so images of the sensors allow for recalibration of the observation. Accurate measurements from REMS are important for comparison to the Mastcam and Navcam dust measurements.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce all these great observations are wrapped up, Curiosity will drive further up the slopes of Mt.

The \"Sorrento Harbor\" target aimed to capture the transition from the Murray bedrock to the vein material, and the \"Bean Point\" target investigated a gray patch among the vein material. This gray patch resembled similar gray patches targeted over the last several weeks given their unique textures and chemistries. The AEGIS-targeted ChemCam raster, acquired post-drive on Sol 1673, ended up hitting the darker, smoother capping material, but GEO complemented it with a second target, \"Cape Levi\", on another patch of this material in front of the rover. The \"Chimney Peak\" target, a raster across multiple layers of Murray bedrock, rounded out our targeted ChemCam activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nGEO kept Mastcam similarly busy. We imaged all the ChemCam targets, acquired a mosaic covering the contact between the darker, smoother capping material, the sulfate vein material, and the underlying Murray, and a stereo mosaic of the \"Moxie Mountain\" outcrop to investigate the dip of the Murray formation at this spot. <br/>\n<br/>\nENV scanned the skies of Gale crater with a variety of images and movies to look for clouds and variations in atmospheric properties. DAN acquired a long passive observation, and regular REMS and RAD measurements will extend our environmental monitoring record within Gale.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the sand-covered terrain a few meters ahead of the rover, the rover planners kept today's drive fairly conservative - 10-15 m - to give us a better look at possible drive paths for the weekend. They'll drive us up to a nice curb of bedrock for weekend targeted and contact science!

Our network, however, stayed on soliday through Wednesday morning, leaving the science team without access to the tools we use to plan activities! For most of planning, this was the only <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FLB_545846876EDR_F0621140FHAZ00302M_&amp;s=1671\">full image</a> the science team had of the terrain in front of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, the rover planners at JPL had a bit better luck, gaining access to enough Navcam and Hazcam images to plan a drive so that the rover did not have to spend the sol idle. The RPs were also able to plan drill diagnostics after the drive to keep investigating the state of the drill. JPL kept the science team posted over the phone - the one way we could communicate with one another. In the event the science team was not able to plan targeted observations, we made plans for basic untargeted post-drive observations that would record the terrain around us (systematically-acquired Mastcam and MARDI images, and an autonomously selected ChemCam target) and help us plan science the next sol (Navcam images of the terrain in front of us and to the starboard side of the rover to target ChemCam and Mastcam). <br/>\n<br/>\nWith just ten minutes to spare before the end of our planning window, our friends in the JPL IT department reestablished the network - it takes a village! The GEO and ENV groups *very* quickly added targeted observations to the already-planned untargeted observations. GEO added a Mastcam image of an autonomously selected ChemCam target shot on Sol 1671, and an 8x2 Mastcam mosaic of an outcrop hypothesized to represent a dry-lake period, parts of which were also studied over the last several sols. ENV planned DAN passive and active observations, and regular REMS and RAD measurements.

Normally the ChemCam team starts Mondays with a telephone tag-up as we hand over operations between the French and US portions of the team. We alternate doing ChemCam operations from week to week, and the Monday teleconferences are the switching point where we convey to the incoming team any useful information that happened the previous week. However, as our French colleagues celebrate Easter a little longer than we do (they have Monday off), we skipped the usual phone tag-up, and traded the usual information by e-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, the French part of the ChemCam team has somewhat more of a challenge, as the daytime operations at JPL in California end up being during the evening and nighttime in France. I attended operations in Toulouse one time and I can verify that operations run very late. French law mandates that employers must provide dinners for anyone who must work late. The operations center at CNES is up to standards with gourmet pre-packaged French cuisine, a small perk for having to work at night. Overall, I have a lot of respect for the dedicated late-night team in France (of course, also for the daytime teams in the US).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back on Mars, Curiosity nailed the 34 meter drive to another rock exposure identified in orbital images.

The main activities in the plan that we\u2019re sending up to the rover today include a 9x7 Mastcam mosaic of the rock outcrop \"Jellison Cove\", MAHLI, APXS, and ChemCam on \"Deer Isle\", and a second ChemCam analysis of \"Calf Island\".</p>"}, "1668": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-1668-1670-diving-into-analysis-of-moosehead-lake", "text": "<p>Our latest drive put us in position in front of the interesting \"Moosehead Lake\" outcrop with lots of veins and grey patches: plenty to keep Curiosity busy over the weekend!

This is followed by a dust devil survey and several Mastcam mosaics. These include one covering Moosehead Lake, a few frames to extend the coverage of the area near the rover, and a big 22 frame mosaic of the outcrop at our next stop.

Of course Curiosity acquired the usual REMS and DAN measurements as well as Navcam cloud observation movies throughout the week. The pointing direction of the cloud movies was shifted from north-facing to south-facing to avoid the sun. The movies will remain pointed towards the south until just after the southern hemisphere spring equinox in May 2018. As mentioned above, there was a Navcam dust devil survey on Sol 1670, as well as one earlier in the week on sol 1668. Also captured earlier this week in ENV planning was a ChemCam passive sky observation on sol 1665 that had been previously dropped twice from the plan due to the DSN outage two weeks ago and sun safety issues last week. Planning passive sky observations is difficult: they are among the most time consuming and time constrained atmospheric observations. This is because the observation requires ChemCam to take passive spectra of the sky at two different azimuths and ChemCam must avoid the sun\u2019s path as it slews between those locations. This can be difficult near equinoxes when the sun passes directly overhead!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>"}, "1666": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sols-1666-1667-moosehead-lake", "text": "<p>The Sol 1664 drive was halted after the rover had driven less than 2 meters because the angle of the left bogie slightly exceeded the suspension limit.

Two of these blocks are within reach of the arm, but both are challenging targets. Even the name chosen for the dark block at the left side of the image above is difficult: \"Passagassawakeag.\" It's pointier that we would like for contact science, and the other dark block, dubbed \"Perry\" (at lower right in the image above), is close enough to the rover that there is a risk of collision with the arm. Complicating the plan further, the best time to take MAHLI images of these targets is late in the afternoon, when they won't be shadowed by the arm. But the last chance to send data to Earth in time to make them available for planning tomorrow is earlier in the afternoon, making it difficult to return all of the data needed to respond to a possible arm fault. Therefore, we decided to acquire a single MAHLI image of Passagassawakeag from a safe distance of 5 cm before the critical communications opportunity, and send it in case the full suite of MAHLI images of Perry planned later in the afternoon is not successful. We would then be better able to plan contact science on Perry tomorrow if necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sol 1609 plan starts with ChemCam and Right Mastcam observation of Passagassawakeag, a typical Murray bedrock exposure named \"Spurwink,\" and a more distant dark block called \"Wassataquoik\" (another tongue-twister).

I\u2019m on duty as GSTL today, and we knew it would be a big plan going in to the weekend. Once we confirmed that the ~26 m drive went well on Sol 1401, our first task was to evaluate the local bedrock and select a target for contact science. We selected a target named \"Uku\" for ChemCam, Mastcam, MAHLI and APXS activities to assess the texture and composition of the Murray formation. We also planned a ChemCam observation on the target \"Songo,\" a disturbed block which looks more red than some of the surrounding rocks. The plan also includes some Mastcam mosaics of the \"Bimbe\" blocky deposit to see if we want to pursue some additional observations there next week. Then we had to see if these activities would fit with an already full weekend plan. On the first and third sols we\u2019re planning to do some environmental monitoring observations coordinated with observations from the MAVEN spacecraft .

On Mars,\nthe rover stopped its drive early because it detected that its wheels were\nslipping in the sand, so we weren\u2019t where we expected to be and we had to\nadjust our observations accordingly. At the same time on Earth, some network\nissues at JPL made it difficult for many of us to connect to the tools that we\nuse to do our planning. Luckily those issues didn\u2019t start up until the planning\nfor Sol 924 was pretty far along, so we were still able to get a good plan put\ntogether.\nOn sol 924, ChemCam analyzed a layered rock target called \"Hennefer\",\nand Mastcam took a supporting image. Mastcam also took a mosaic of the outcrop\nwe are heading toward, called \"Garden City\", as well as a small mosaic of the\nsand ripple (called \"Tropic Ripple\") near where we stopped, and a mosaic of a\ntiny crater that we called \"Hemicyon Basin.\"\nAfter that, the rover continued on its drive toward Garden\nCity. After the drive, ChemCam did a calibration measurement, MAHLI took an\nimage from its stowed position, and Mastcam took a 2x1 mosaic looking back\nacross the floor of Gale crater toward the \"Peace Vallis\" alluvial fan. Mastcam\nand Navcam also had some atmospheric observations, and Mastcam and Navcam also\ntook some standard post-drive mosaics.\nThis morning things were a lot smoother. We started off\nplanning ogling the beautiful images of the Garden City outcrop, which is\ncris-crossed with erosion resistant ridges. The plan for sol 925 is to do a\nChemCam analysis and associated Mastcam mosaic on one of the nearby ridges\ncalled \"San Timoteo\", along with a Mastcam stereo mosaic of Garden City. Later\nin the day, ChemCam has an observation of a dark rock to test some focusing\nsettings on a very dark target. Then CheMin will do an overnight analysis on\nthe sample that it is currently working on.\nOn the morning of sol 926m ChemCam has some passive observations\nof the sky, and Mastcam and Navcam also have some atmospheric measurements.\nThen the rover will do a short drive toward Garden City, followed by standard\nimaging plus some extra Navcams of the hill that is rising above us.\nFinally on sol 927, Mastcam and Navcam have some more\natmospheric measurements.\nNext week many of us on the science team will be at the\nLunar and Planetary Science Conference, but we will also be eagerly checking in\non what Curiosity is doing at the tantalizing Garden City outcrop. by Ryan Anderson -Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.

And Ken was the Science Operations Working\nGroup (SOWG) chair, meaning that he led the SOWG meeting and made sure that the\nplan satisfied the goals of the science team while also staying within the\nconstraints on power, data, safety, complexity, etc.\nThis morning was a little more \"exciting\" than normal because\nbad weather on Earth caused a disruption in our downlink of data from Mars, so\nfor a little while it looked like we would not have any of the images from the\nend of the drive to help us plan sols 828-829. (We can\u2019t do much if we don\u2019t\nknow what the rover\u2019s surroundings look like!) It also meant that our ChemCam\ndata was missing. But in the end, the data did arrive so that I could assess\nthe ChemCam data and planning could proceed.\nOn sol 828, ChemCam will do a passive observation of the sky\nto measure the abundance of different molecules in the atmosphere, and Navcam (the\nnavigation cameras) will take a movie to watch for clouds forming over Mt.\nSharp. Also in the morning block, Mastcam has a mosaic of the \"Chinle\"\noutcrop to look at the fine-scale layering.\nLater on the same sol, there are a series of observations of\nChinle by MAHLI (the Mars Hand Lens Imager \u2013 a close-up, high-resolution color\ncamera). These observations will look at the layers in Chinle from a different\nangle and at a higher resolution than is possible with the mast cameras. While\nthe arm is out, we will also brush off the target \"Pickhandle\" on Chinle using\nthe Dust Removal Tool (DRT).\nOn Sol 829, Mastcam will do a routine \"clast survey\"\nobservation to characterize the loose rocks near the rover, and ChemCam will\nrun a diagnostic test of the focusing laser that has been acting up recently.\nBy Ryan Anderson -Ryan Anderson is a planetary scientist and developer at the USGS\nAstrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.

The engineers at JPL have done a lot of testing in the Mars Yard and compared the results with the many images of the wheels on Mars. Although these images show that wheel wear continues, the damage is accumulating at a lower rate due to the changes in traverse planning that have been implemented in the past few months. Driving over rough terrain appears to be the most significant threat to the wheels, and efforts to recognize and avoid hazardous terrain using data returned by Mars orbiters have allowed safer drive paths to be chosen. It was clear that the engineers are not as concerned about wheel wear as they were last fall, and that they do not feel that wheel wear will limit the lifetime of rover mobility. This conclusion was based in part on tests in the JPL Mars Yard that showed that even very heavily damaged wheels performed well in climbing rocky and sandy slopes.</p>"}, "603": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-603-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-seeking-a-drill-site", "text": "<p>While most of the MSL science team met at Caltech to discuss recent results and plans for the near future, the tactical team planned a 65-meter drive toward the southeastern side of Mount Remarkable, near the site chosen for the next drilling campaign.

On of the disadvantages of working on \"Earth time\" (reasonable hours Pacific time) is that, almost half the time, we receive data from MSL too late in the day to react to it tactically. So we have to plan a day in advance, and assume that the previously planned activities went well. We planned a 35-meter drive yesterday, but won't know how it went until late this afternoon. Therefore, we could plan only activities that didn't depend on accurate knowledge of the rover position and orientation. The most important activity we planned for Sol 103 is a checkout of MSL's drill, which won't take too long, so we had room for opportunistic science activities. These included a DAN active measurement of the hydrogen below the surface at our new location, and a 180-degree Navcam panorama to complete the coverage of the area surrounding the rover.

As I mentioned previously, we have been looking for a relatively fine-grained soil patch to scoop into CHIMRA, the \"Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis\" subsystem. CHIMRA will be used to sieve and portion samples into the CheMin and SAM instruments for mineralogic and organic chemical analysis. But before such samples will be delivered, some Martian soil will be used to clean any terrestrial contamination from CHIMRA by passing it through the system. So today's plan included the first \"scuff\" by one of the rover wheels, intended to measure the depth of the ripple and determine whether it is safe to scoop it. To scuff, the left front wheel will be rolled over the ripple, then that wheel will be rotated while the other 5 wheels are held stationary. This should allow a cross-section of the ripple to be imaged, and the composition of the interior of the ripple to be examined. After the scuff is complete, the rover will move back to essentially its current position to allow the arm to be used to place the MAHLI and APXS instruments into the scuffed area.</p>"}, "51": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-51-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-back-in-flagstaff", "text": "<p>I haven't been following the MSL mission for the last couple days, traveling back to Flagstaff to give a talk about Mars rovers for the Flagstaff Festival of Science today at Lowell Observatory.

Then I turned to MSL, and ran out of time even though I left out one of the cool videos I planned to show.

Too bad, because it would been nice to have included in my presentation images of the outcrop that was the subject of the press conference. A few sols ago, we drove by an outcrop that was immediately recognized as conglomerate, a poorly-sorted sediment that is commonly formed in stream beds on Earth.

We are currently searching for a larger ripple or windblown drift for the first use of MSL's scoop, and these observations should help us determine how suitable such a ripple would be for scooping. The goal is to find a fine-grained deposit that can be \"fed\" to the mechanism on the arm that will be used to crush and sort samples before they are delivered to the mineralogy and chemistry experiments inside the rover. Processing a sandy sample will not only test this mechanism, it will sweep out any terrestrial contamination still remaining in it. The entire rover was carefully cleaned before launch, but it is very difficult to remove all traces of Earth, so passing Martian soil through the mechanism will \"clean\" it out. Another drive was planned for Sol 50, after the ripple observations. The Geology Theme Group focused on post-drive imaging, working with the Rover Planners to get the images they need to plan the following drive. We planned full 360-degree Navcam and Mastcam panoramas from the new location, which should allow us to pick a good soil target for scooping. Only the Navcam (wide-angle) images will be received in time to be used for planning Sol 51 observations, so we will use those images to determine which of the Mastcam images should be sent to Earth right away.

Because I didn't have to focus on today's planning as much, I was\nable to catch up on some other tasks, including processing new MARDI images\nto determine how much they can be compressed and still preserve the details\nneeded for geologic interpretation. I also looked at some older ChemCam\nRMI images that were taken in the MSL testbed (a nearly identical copy of\nthe real rover at JPL) to test various types of image compression. I had\nbeen meaning to get this done long ago, but was too busy with other work.\nSo far it looks like we will be able to reduce the size of these images\nwithout significantly degrading them. We must make the most of the\nprecious bits we receive from MSL through the Mars orbiters, so I need to\ncomplete this analysis soon.\nKen</p>"}, "26": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-26-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-mars-time", "text": "<p>The best news today was that analysis of more detailed ChemCam engineering data showed that the problems noted a few sols ago were very minor and now completely understood, so the instrument can now be used again! While we suspected that the problem was not serious, it was very nice to receive confirmation.\nWe finally received the images needed to plan the next drive, so the Sol 26 plan includes a checkout of the \"visual odometry\" software that will be used by the rover to precisely determine how far it has moved using images taken during the drive. Once the data from this and previous driving tests are received and analyzed, all of the rover mobility software will be validated. Of course we are hoping that all goes well, as visual odometry will allow MSL to approach targets accurately enough to put them in the \"workspace\" of the arm. Even if the rover slips in sand or on a steep slope, it will be able to automatically account for any slip and get where we want to go. This will save lots of time in the future.\nToday \"Mars time\" at Gale crater is about the same as \"Earth time\" (PDT). The tactical team's workday always starts in the afternoon at Gale, when the rover sends data to the orbiters as they fly overhead. We then work all Mars night to analyze and understand the data MSL has sent to us, then plan what we want the rover to do the next day in time to send the commands the following Mars morning. So today the first shift came in to work in the Earth afternoon, and the second shift will work through the Earth night, finishing up as the sun is rising in Pasadena. Because Mars' day is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, our workday will begin later and later in Pacific time. and the current coincidence of Gale and Pasadena time will not recur for about 5 weeks.\nKen</p>"}, "25": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-25-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-sunlight-versus-shadow", "text": "<p>As predicted, we didn't receive enough data through MRO today to allow us to plan another drive. So while we wait for the images taken after the Sol 24 drive to arrive, we planned a bunch of images to be taken on Sol 25. I was MAHLI/MARDI Payload Uplink Lead 1 today, which means that my job was to focus on how best to use the Mars Hand-Lens Imager (MAHLI) and the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) cameras. MAHLI is on the end of the instrument arm, which has not been checked out on Mars yet, so we can't use that camera yet. And you might expect that MARDI won't be used again because MSL already descended to the surface of Mars on August 5th. Well, it turns out that MARDI can still take useful pictures of Mars, looking straight down at the surface just behind the left front wheel of MSL. Eventually we hope to use MARDI to take images as MSL drives, but that won't be possible until the next version of the rover's software is uploaded and installed. In the meantime, we are taking a single MARDI image at each place the rover stops. So my job today was to find the best time to take such an image. The rover planners (drivers) didn't have much to do today, so I asked Matt Heverly, the rover mobility lead, to help me figure out whether this image would be in shadow or sunlight. We had received enough data through MRO to know that the Sol 14 drive went well, and that the rover heading was WSW (116.5 degrees azimuth relative to north). Using this information, Matt modeled the shadow of the rover in the fancy software the rover planners use to build drive and arm sequences, developed at JPL. We had planned a MARDI image on the afternoon of Sol 24 when the surface under the camera was fully shadowed, but didn't know whether it was successfully acquired because it was taken after MRO flew over MSL and received a burst of data from the rover. I thought that it would be interesting to see what the surface looks like when fully illuminated by the sun, and Matt's modeling showed that the surface would be in sunlight after 4:02 PM. Before that time, the rover would shadow the surface, but later the sunlight would pass under the rover for about an hour before sunset. So I suggested adding this observation to the plan at low priority, and the Geology theme lead agreed to include it. Because it didn't conflict with any other suggestions from the science team, it was included in the final plan that was submitted to the second-shift uplink planning team! So my work paid off and I look forward to seeing both the shadowed and sunlit images of the same spot. Comparing them will help us decide whether to take future MARDI images in sunlight or shadow.\nKen</p>"}, "24": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-24-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-autonomous-navigation", "text": "<p>The highlight of the Sol 24 plan is to test some of the software that will\nallow the rover to avoid obstacles automatically.

It's nice to see my recent efforts paying off, but of course it takes many people working very hard to make it happen. Today we planned a sequence of images intended to determine how well we can measure the topography of the surface far from the rover using \"long-baseline stereo.\" MSL has several pairs of stereo cameras that work very much like human (and other animal) pairs of eyes. Our brains interpret the information from both eyes to tell how far away objects are, and cameras can be used to do the same thing. The distance between our eyes, or the \"baseline\" between cameras limits the distance at which this method works. The longer the baseline, or the greater the distance between cameras, the better the ability to measure distance. So our plan is to take pictures of Mt. Sharp, many kilometers from the rover, before and after moving the rover about 10 m. In order for this experiment to yield useful results, the camera must be properly focused. So it was good to receive some of the data from the focus test in time to plan this next experiment.\nA different song is played at the beginning of each Martian day (sol) as the daily bundle of commands are sent to the rover.

I feel extremely fortunate to\nbe involved in yet another successful Mars rover mission--we are now 4 for\n4 (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity), with 2 rovers still\nactive. Wow.\nI spent most of the day continuing to work Mastcam characterization\nsequences into the near-term plan. In addition to the daily tactical work,\nmany people are focused on planning what the rover will do for the next\nweek or so. I've been representing the Mastcam team's interests in these\nstrategic planning discussions and meetings, and despite numerous\nconstraints and evolving scientific goals, it has been going fairly well.\nBut it struck me today that it is a bit strange that I have been so focused\non Mastcam. To explain, I must first summarize how I got involved in the\nfirst place: In 2004, many teams of scientists were preparing proposals\nin response to NASA's announcement of an opportunity to develop, test and\noperate instruments for the MSL mission. I was invited to join some of\nthese teams, and was included as a Co-Investigator on the ChemCam, MARDI\n(descent imager) and MAHLI (hand-lens imager) proposals, but not on the\nMastcam proposal. The MARDI, MAHLI and Mastcam proposals were all\nsubmitted by Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS), a small company in San\nDiego specializing in building cameras to be flown on spacecraft. The\ncompany was founded by Mike Malin after he was awarded a MacArthur\nFellowship ( \"genius grant\" ) in 1987. Each of the proposals included a clause stating that if all 3 were selected,\nMSSS would give NASA a 30% discount. Apparently NASA couldn't pass that\nup, and all 3 cameras were selected to fly on MSL. In addition to\nconsolidating the design and test efforts at MSSS, the 3 science teams were\nmerged into one big team. So I became a member of the Mastcam team, along\nwith the other Co-Is on the MARDI and MAHLI science teams. But I always\nexpected to focus on MAHLI and MARDI, having put more effort into the\ndevelopment of those cameras. While I didn't foresee my recent heavy\ninvolvement in Mastcam planning, I was happy to contribute to the team\neffort. I recognized the importance of getting the Mastcam\ncharacterization data needed to improve the quality of the images as soon\nas possible, and jumped right in. Hopefully this effort will pay off--we\nexpect the first results of the focus and stereo tests tomorrow morning.\nKen</p>"}, "16": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-16-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-wiggling-wheels", "text": "<p>First the bad news: The REMS (meteorology experiment) team confirmed that\ntwo out of 3 wind sensors on one of the two booms on the remote sensing\nmast are permanently damaged and cannot be used.

The\nmost likely explanation for the damage is that the descent rockets threw\ndirt up on the top of MSL during landing, but it will be a while before we\ncan take pictures (using the camera on the arm) to confirm this. The other\nsad news is that one of the leaders of the engineering team, Jake Matijevic\npassed away last weekend. I worked with Jake on the Mars\nPathfinder/Sojourner project over 15 years ago, and again on the Mars\nExploration Rover project. I enjoyed every interaction I had with him, and\nalong with the rest of the MSL team will miss his contributions to the\nlatest, most ambitious rover project.\nAnd now the good news: More cheers and applause today as MSL successfully\ndeployed its arm and wiggled its wheels in preparation for its first drive.

The decision was great news for JPL, as the mission is led by Bruce Banerdt, a JPL geophysicist, and will involve many other JPL scientists and engineers in the next few years. Despite the successful landing of MSL this month, JPL has had to lay off hundreds of employees, in part because the peak in the\neffort to develop MSL has passed and there are few NASA planetary missions\nin the queue. InSight, a mission to explore the interior of Mars using a\nseismometer, will keep at least a few engineers and scientists busy,\navoiding further layoffs.

Each orbiter (MRO and Mars Odyssey) flies over MSL twice a day, early in the morning and late in the afternoon. But they don't fly over MSL at the same time every day, because their orbits were designed to view different parts of Mars every sol so that the orbiter instruments can observe a wide variety of locations on the planet.

A nice aspect of working first shift is\nthat it involves more interaction with the science team, which is less\ninvolved in detailed command sequence planning during second shift. I\nstarted my work day by getting back up to speed on rover operations,\nlooking at recent data and discussing priorities for new scientific\nobservations. Rover checkout continues, and we are getting more scientific\ndata from various instruments.\nDuring the first big meeting of the day, the \"Science Kickoff,\" we heard\nupdates on each of the instruments. We all applauded when the Dynamic\nAlbedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument reported successful completion of their\nfirst \"passive\" observation, in which naturally-generated neutrons were\nmeasured from Mars. We also received some more MARDI (descent image) full\nframes, all of which are beautiful, and there are many more MARDI images\nstill awaiting transmission to Earth. More instrument checkouts were\nplanned for Sol 10, as well as continued updates of rover software. At the\nend of my shift, I handed off science leadership to the SUR (Science Uplink\nRepresentative, the same role I filled during the first 3 planning sols)\nand gave him some advice based on my previous experience. Then I attended\na cameras team meeting in another building at JPL that ended up running\nlate, so that I didn't leave JPL until about 6:30, over 13 hours after I\narrived. But I felt good despite the long hours, and recalled working an\naverage of 14 hours/day during the early part of the Spirit and Opportunity\nmissions. So not a bad day at all!\nKen</p>"}, "3": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-3-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-navcam-panorama", "text": "<p>Another good day on Mars: MSL's remote sensing mast was successfully\ndeployed, and a Navcam panorama acquired. Not all of the images have been\nsent to Earth yet, but those that have been received are very useful for\nplanning future observations . In addition, more full-resolution descent images have been received, showing the heat shield soon after it was jettisoned and the surface close-up after landing. Hundreds of MARDI images like these were acquired during descent and landing, and it will take weeks to months to send them back to Earth. But when they are\nreceived, the full-resolution animation of the descent sequence will be spectacular. This has been the theme of the mission so far--we must be patient.\nToday was my last shift this month as Science Uplink Representative,\nand planning went well again. The plan for Sol 3 included a Mastcam color\npanorama which will have about 4x better resolution than the Navcam black\nand white panorama. The plan also includes checkouts of 4 of the\ninstruments that have not been turned on since landing: the Alpha Particle\nX-ray Spectrometer (APXS), which will measure elemental chemistry; the\nDynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) experiment, which will measure the\nabundance of hydrogen (water) up to 1 m below the surface; CheMin, an X-ray\ndiffraction and fluorescence instrument that will determine the mineralogy\nof samples delivered to it by the rover's arm; and SAM, the Sample Analysis\nat Mars suite of 3 instruments that will search for organics and measure\nthe isotopic composition of Martian rocks, soil and atmosphere. Of course\nwe all hope that these instruments have survived landing and are working\nwell.\nMy tactical operations shifts have been exciting, and I've enjoyed\nworking with the talented and knowledgeable engineers and scientist on the\ntactical team. But I'm also looking forward to taking a break for a few\ndays and sleeping past 4:30 in the morning!\nKen</p>"}, "2": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-2-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-planning-report", "text": "<p>Today I'm working as Science Uplink Representative again, planning\nSol 2 activities. We now know exactly where MSL is, thanks to more good\nwork by the MRO HiRISE team: They acquired a new image of the landing area\nthat shows not only the rover, but its heat shield, parachute, and descent\nstage, all in the same image !\nSo the MSL team is starting to plan where to drive, but I have not been\ndirectly involved in those discussions because they have been occurring\nduring first shift. Certainly we must move out of the area contaminated by\nthe landing rockets before analyzing samples of the soil.\nThe plan for today includes deploying the remote sensing mast,\nobviously an important activity, as we cannot use the mast cameras and\nChemCam instrument until the mast is deployed. Once the mast has been\ndeployed, the navigation cameras will take a full, 360-degree panorama of\nthe terrain around us and another panorama of the rover deck. Based on the\nhazard avoidance camera images received so far , the Navcam panorama should be spectacular!\nDuring one of the tactical planning meeting today, we were\ninterrupted by the Project Manager for a surprise visit from U.S.\nCongressman John Culberson of Texas. He was impressed by the mission\noperations area and vowed to protect us from interference from NASA\nHeadquarters, so that we can do our jobs efficiently. I'm not particularly\nfond of politicians, but it was an honor to hear him thank us for our\nefforts and we all applauded after his brief speech. Hopefully he will\nvote to restore funding for NASA's Mars Program in fiscal 2013!\nKen</p>"}, "1": {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/mars-rover-curiosity-mission-updates/?mu=sol-1-update-on-curiosity-from-usgs-scientist-ken-herkenhoff-tactical-operations", "text": "<p>I'm working second shift today; my tactical operations role is\nScience Uplink Representative. As the title implies, my responsibility is\nto represent the science team during the uplink planning process (preparing\ncommand sequences to be transmitted to the spacecraft). The early part of\nthe MSL mission, called the Characterization Activity Phase, has been\nplanned and tested in detail; the nominal command sequences were loaded\nonto the spacecraft well before landing. As long as the mission continues\nto proceed nominally, no changes to the sequences will be needed, and the\nuplink planning process will primarily involve modeling the planned\nactivities to confirm that they should be executed.\nIt was difficult to leave JPL soon after landing, but I knew I had to\nget some sleep before my shift started at 5:30 PDT. I got almost 4 hours\nof sleep, so I'm doing fine so far. I arrived at JPL as morning twilight\nbegan, with Venus and Jupiter shining brightly over the San Gabriel\nMountains. Many team members were still at JPL when I arrived, but because\nthey had been up all night, most of them left soon after sunrise in\nPasadena. It was then much quieter in the operations area as the team\nfocused on uplink planning. As I met colleagues I hadn't seen earlier, we\ncongratulated each other but the excitement of landing had mostly passed.\nOf course everyone is happy to be involved in the surface phase of the\nmission, but the focus is now on doing the jobs we have been rehearsing for\nthe past few months. One of the rehearsals simulated multiple anomalies,\nand we are all glad that our experience in responding to anomalies has not\nbeen needed. The mission is going so well that the mood has gone from\n\"adrenaline rush\" to \"business as usual\" in just a few hours.\nWe just received several of the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) images,\nshowing sections of the \"movie\" of the descent and landing from the rover.\nApplause broke out in the camera team's room as the PI, Mike Malin, showed\nus the data. These images will allow us to locate the rover precisely.\nEarlier this morning the MRO HiRISE image of the lander descending on its\nparachute was received, and it is SPECTACULAR. It is the result of months of\nplanning, requiring coordination between the MSL and MRO projects to\ncomplete a very complicated observation design. The HiRISE team did a\ngreat job in support of MSL!\nKen\nRead more on how the USGS is involved with the MSL mission\u2026 Read official USGS press release\u2026</p>"}}
